## DEDICATION.

TO
SIR ROGER MOSTYN, BAR<sup>T</sup>. OF MOSTYN, FLINTSHIRE.

DEAR SIR,

A GENTLEMAN well known to the political
world in the beginning of the present century made
the tour of *Europe*, and before he reached *Abbeville*
discovered that in order to see a country to best advantage it
was infinitely preferable to travel by day than by night.

I cannot help making this applicable to myself, who,
after publishing three volumes of the *Zoology* of GREAT
BRITAIN, found out that to be able to speak with more
precision of the subjects I treated of, it was far more prudent
to visit the whole than part of my country: struck therefore
with the reflection of having never seen SCOTLAND, I instantly
ordered my baggage to be got ready, and in a reasonable
time found myself on the banks of the *Tweed*.

As soon as I communicated to you my resolution, with
your accustomed friendship you wished to hear from me: I
could give but a partial performance of my promise, the
attention of a traveller being so much taken up as to leave
very little room for epistolary duties; and I flatter myself
you will find this tardy execution of my engagement more
satisfactory than the hasty accounts I could send you on my
road. But this is far from being the sole motive of this
address.

I have irresistible inducements of public and of a private
nature: to you I owe a most free enjoyment of the little
territories Providence had bestowed on me; for by a liberal
and equal cession of fields, and meads and woods, you connected
all the divided parts, and gave a full scope to all my
improvements. Every view I take from my window reminds
me of my debt, and forbids my silence, causing the
pleasing glow of gratitude to diffuse itself over the whole
frame, instead of forcing up the imbittering sigh of *Oh!*
*si angulus ille!* Now every scene I enjoy receives new charms,
for I mingle with the visible beauties, the more pleasing idea
of owing them to you, the worthy neighbor and firm friend,
who are happy in the calm and domestic paths of life with
abilities superior to ostentation, and goodness content with
its own reward: with a sound judgement and honest heart
you worthily discharge the senatorial trust reposed in you,
whose unprejudiced vote aids to still the madness of the
People, or aims to check the presumption of the Minister.
My happiness in being from your earliest life your neighbor,
makes me confident in my observation; your increasing and
discerning band of friends discovers and confirms the justice
of it: may the reasons that attract and bind us to you ever
remain, is the most grateful wish that can be thought of, by,

DEAR SIR,

*Your obliged, and affectionate Friend,*

THOMAS PENNANT.

## A TOUR IN SCOTLAND.

MDCCLXIX.


### CHESTER

ON Monday the 26th of June, take my departure from
Chester, a city without parallel for the singular structure
of the four principal streets, which are as if excavated
out of the earth, and sunk many feet beneath the surface;
the carriages drive far beneath the level of the kitchens, on a line
with ranges of shops, over which on each side of the streets passengers
walk from end to end, in galleries open in front, secure from wet
or heat. The back courts of all these houses are level with the
ground, but to go into any of these four streets it is necessary
to descend a flight of several steps.

The Cathedral is an ancient structure, very ragged on the outside,
from the nature of the red friable stone[^saxum] with which it is built: the
tabernacle work in the choir is very neat; but the beauty and elegant
simplicity of a very antique gothic chapter-house, is what merits
a visit from every traveller.

The Hypocaust near the Feathers Inn, is one of the remains of the
Romans[^this-city], it being well known that this place was a principal station.
Among many antiquities found here, none is more singular
than the rude sculpture of the Dea Armigera Minerva, with her bird
and her altar, on the face of a rock in a small field near the Welch
end of the bridge.

The castle is a decaying pile. The walls of the city, the only
complete specimens of ancient fortifications, are kept in excellent
order, being the principal walk of the inhabitants: the views from
the several parts are very fine; the mountains of Flintshire, the hills
of Broxton, and the insulated rock of Beeston, form the ruder part of
the scenery; a rich flat forms the softer view, and the prospect up
the river towards Boughton recalls in some degree the idea of the
Thames and Richmond hill.

Passed through Tarvin, a small village; in the church-yard is
an epitaph in memory of Mr. John Thomasen, an excellent penman,
but particularly famous for his exact and elegant imitation of the
Greek character.

Delamere, which Leland calls a faire and large forest, with plenty
of redde deere and falow, is now a black and dreary waste; it feeds
a few rabbets; and a few black Terns[^br] skim over the splashes that
water some part of it.


### SALT PITS

A few miles from this heath lies Northwich, a small town, long  SatrPurs.
* famous for its rock salt, and brine pits. ‘Some years ago I visited
one of the mines ; the stratum of salt lies about forty yards deep;
* that which I saw was hollowed into the form of a temple. I de-
scended thro’ a dome, and found the roof supported by rows of
pillars, about two yards thick, and several in height ; the whole was
illuminated with numbers of candles, and made a most magnificent
' and glittering appearance. Above the falt is a bed of whitish clay +,
used in making the Liverpool earthen-ware ; and in the same place
is also dug a good deal of the Gypsum, or plaifter stone, The fossil ;
falt is generally yellow, and semipellucid, sometimes debafed with a
dull greenish earth, and is often found, but in small quantities,
quite clear and colorless. ;
The road from this place to Macclesfield is thro’ a flat, rich, but
unpleasant country. That town is in a very flourishing state; is
possessed of a great manufacture of mohair and twist buttons ; has
between twenty and thirty silk mills, and a very considerable copper
smelting house, and brass work.
Here lived in great hospitality, at his manor-houfe 4, Henry Staf-
ford, Duke of Buckingham, a most powerful Peer, the sad instrument |
of the 'ambition of Richard III, He was at once rewarded by that
‘monarch || with a grant of fifty castles and manors ; but struck with
remorse at being accessary to so many ctimes, fell from his allegiance,

and by a juft retribution, fuffered on a fcaffold by the mere fiat of
his unfeeling mafter.
In the church is the fepulchral chapel, and the magnificent monu-
ments of the family of the Savages. In this part of the church had
; been a chauntry of secular priests, founded about 1508 by Thomas
Savage, archbishop of York *, who directed that his heart should be
deposited here, On a brass plate on the wall is this comfortable ;
advertisement of the price of remission of sins in the other life: it
was to be wished that the expence of obtaining so extensive a charter
from his holiness in this world had likewise been added.
' These are the words.
The Pdon for saying of 5 Pater noft and 5 aves and a creed is 26
thousand yeres and 26 dayes of Pardon.
In the chapel belonging to the Leghs of Lyme is another singular
inscription and its history.
[ Here lyeth the body of Perkin a Legd ,

© In their memorie Sir Peter Legh of Lyme knight descended from b
* them finding the fayd ould verses written upon a stone in this
* Chappel did reedifie this place An? Dni 1620.’
After leaving this town, the country almost instantly changes and -
becomes very mountanous and barren, at lest on the surface ; but
the bowels compensate for the external sterility, by yielding sufficient
quantity of coal for the use of the neighboring parts of Cheshire, and
for the burning of lime : vast quantity is made near Buxton, and
being carried to all parts for the purposes of agriculture, is become
a considerable article of commerce, ;
The celebrated warm bath of Buxron® is seated in a bottom, Buxron.
amidst these hills, in a most cheerlefs spot, and would be little fre-
quented, did .:not Hygeia often reside here, and dispense to her
votaries the chief blessings of life, ease and health, With joy
. and gratitude I this moment reflect on the efficacious qualities of
the waters; I recollect with rapture the return of spirits, the flight |
of pain, and re-animation of my long, long-crippled rheumatic
limbs. But how unfortunate is it, that what Providence defigned for .
the general good, should be rendered only a partial one, and denied
to all, except the opulent; or I may fay to the (comparatively) few
that can get admittance into the house where these waters are im-
* The Romans, who were remarkably fond of warm baths, did not overlook
these agreeable waters: they had a bath, inclofed with a brick wall, adjacent to *
the present St. fzxe's well, which Dr. Shert, in his Eflay on Mineral Waters, says
was razed in 1709,

prisoned ? There are other springs (Camden says nine) very near
that in the Hall, and in all probability of equal virtue. IT was in-
formed that the late Duke of Devonshire, not long before his death,
had ordered some of these to be inclosed and formed into baths. It
is to be hoped that his successor will not fail adopting fo useful and
humane a plan; that he will form it on the most enlarged system,
that they may open not solely to those whom misused wealth hath
‘rendered invalids, but to the poor cripple, whom honest labor
hath made a burden to himself and his country; and to the foldier
; and sailor, who by hard service have loft the use of those very limbs
which once were active in our defence. The honor resulting
_— from such a foundatioh would be as great, as the fatisfaction
arising from a consciousness of so benevolent a work would be un-
; speakable, The charms of diffipation would then lose their force; -
. and every human luxury would appear to him infipid, who had
it in his power thus to lay open these fountains of health, and
to be able to exult in such pathetic and comfortable strains as
. these : When the ear heard me, then it blessed me, and when the eye saw
. me it gave witness to me z
Because I had delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and
him that had none to help him.
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon 'me, and I
. caused the widow's heart to fing for joy.
I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
After leaving Buxton, passed thro’ Middleton dale, a deep narrow
chasm between two vast cliffs, which extend on each fide, near a
- mile in length: this road is very singular, but the rocks are ‘in
general too naked to be beautiful, At the end is the’ small vistage
of

of Stoney Middleton , here the profpect opens, and at Barfly Bridge
exhibits a pretty view of a small but fertile vale, watered by the *
Derwent, and terminated by Chatsworth and its plantations. Arrived
and lay. at

Cbefterfield; an ugly town. In this place is a great manufacture
of warsted stockings, and another of a brown earthen-ware, much
of which is sent into Holland, the country which, within less .than
half a century ago, supplied not only these kingdoms but. half
of Europe with that commodity. The clay is found near the
town, over the bass or cherty * stratum, above the coal. The
steeple of Chefterfield church is a spire covered with lead, but by a °
violent wind ftrangely bent, in which ftate it remains. In the
church are some fine monuments of the Foljambes of Walton. :

At this place may be said to have expired the war of the
Barons in the reign of Henry III. After the battle of Evebam,
Robert Earl Ferrers, and Baldwin Wake Baron of Chefterfield, at-
tempted once more to make head against the royal power. They
rendevoused here; but were suddenly surprized by the royalists ;
Ferrers was taken, and Wake fled. The estate of the first was
forfeited ; the fortunes of the last were restored, after certain
muléts. By the marriage of a sister of one of his descendants
with Edmund of Woodstock, this place and Bakewell became the pro-
perty of his daughter, the fair Maid of Kent, widow of the Black '
Prince, and were part of her jointure on his decease.

On the road fide, about three miles from the town, are several pits Juns 27. ,
of iron-stone about nine or ten feet deep, The stratum lies above
the coal, and is two feet thick. I was informed that the adventurers

. ' pay ten pounds per annum to the lord of the foil, for liberty of
raifing it; that the laborers have fix fhillings per load for get-
ting it: each load is about twenty ftrikes or bufhels, which yields
a tun of metal. Coal, in these parts is very cheap, a tun and a half
being sold for five shillings.
Changed horses at Worksop and Tuxford. In the south aisle of the
church at Tuxford, beneath a flowery arch, is a very rude relief of St.
Laurence placed on the gridiron. By him is a fellow with a bellows
blowing the fire; and the executioner going to turn him, The
zealous Fox in his Martyrology has this very thought, and makes
® the martyr say in the midst of sufferings, This side is now roasted; turn
me, O tyrant great! Crossed the Trent at Dunham-Ferry, where it is
broad, but shallow : the' spring tides flow here, and rise about two
feet, but the common tides never reach this place. Dunham had ;
been a manor belonging to Edward * the Confeffor, and yielded |
him thirty pounds, and six sextaries of honey, valuable, when mead |
was the delicious beverage of the times. From hence pass along
the Fos5-Dike, or the canal opened by Henry I.+ to form a communi-
cation between the Trent and the Witham, It was opened þ in the |
year 1121, and extends from Lincoln to Torkesey ; its length is eleven

miles three quarters, the breadth between dike and dike at the
top is about sixty feet, at bottom twenty-two: vessels from fif-
teen to thirty-five tuns navigate this canal, and by its means a
confiderable trade in-coals, timber, corn and wool, is carried on.
In former times, the persons who had landed pr. perty on either
fide were obliged to fcower it whenever it was choaked up, and
accordingly we find prefentments were made by juries in feveral
fucceeding reigns for that purpofe. Reach
Lincotn, an ancient but ill-built city, much fallen away from
its former extent. It lies partly on a plain, partly on a very fteep
hill, on whofe fummit are the cathedral and the ruins of the caftle.
. The first is a vast pile of gothic architecture ; within of matchless
beauty and magnificence: the ornaments are exceffively rich, and
in the finest gothic tafte; the pillars light, the centre lofty, and of
a surprising grandeur. The windows at the N. and S. ends are very
antient, but very elegant ; one represents a leaf with its fibres, the
other consists of a number of small circles. There are two other @.
antient windows on each side the great ifle: the others, as I re- .
collet, are modern. This church was, till of late years, much
out of repair, but has juft been reftored in a manner that does
credit. to the Chapter,
The prospect from this eminence is very extensive, but very bar-
ren of objects; a valt flat as far as the eye can reach, consisting of .
Plains not the most fertile, or of fens * and moors: the laft are far
less ,
® The fens, naked as they now appear, were once well wooded. Oaks have
been found buried in them, which were sixteen yards long, and five in circumfe-
rence; fir trees from thirty to thirty-five yards long, and a foot or eighteen inches

10 | A T O U R
less extensive than they were, many being drained, and will soon
. become the best land in the country; but much still remains to be
done. The fens near Revesby Abby *, eight miles beyond Horncastle, ©
are of vast extent; but serve for little other purpose than the rear-
ing great numbers of geese, which are the wealth of the fenmen,
Gnas. During the breeding season, these birds are lodged in the same
houses with the inhabitants, and even in their very bed-chambers :
in every apartment are three rows of coarse wicker pens placed one
above another; each bird has its separate lodge divided from the
other, which it keeps possession of during the time of sitting, A |
person, called a Gozzard +, attends the flock, and twice a day drives
the whole to water; then brings them back to their habitations,
helping thofe that live in the upper ftories tq their nefts, without -
ever mifplacing a fingle bird.
The geese are plucked five times in the year ; the first plucking
| is at Lady-Day, for feathers and quills, and the same is renewed,
for feathers only, four times more between that and Michaelmas. |
. The old geese submir quietly to the operation, but the young ones
are very noisy and unruly. I once saw this performed, and ob-
served that goslings of six weeks old were not spared ; for their tails
were plucked, as I was told, to habituate them early to what they
square, These trees had not the mark of the ax, but appeared as if burnt down
by fire applied to their lower parts. Acorns and small nuts have also been found
in great quantities in the same places. Dugdale on embanking, 141. |

were to come to. If the season proves cold, numbers of geese die
by this barbarous custom *.

Vast numbers are driven annually to London, to supply the ,
markets; among them, all the fuperannuated geefe and ganders
(called here Cagmags) which ferve to fatigue the jaws of the good
Citizens, who are fo unfortunate as to meet with them.

The fen called the We? Fen, is the place where the Ruffs and Fen Biros.
Reeves refort to in the greatest numbers +; and many other forts of
water fowl, which do not require the shelter of reeds or rushes,
migrate here to breed ; for this fen is very bare, having been im-
perfectly drained by narrow canals, which interse& it for great
numbers of miles. These the inhabitants navigate in most diminu-
tive shallow boats ; they are, in fact, the roads of the country.

The Eaft Fen is quite in a state of nature, and gives a specimen
of the country before the introduction of drainage : it is a vaft tract \
of morass, intermixed with numbers of lakes from half a mile to
two or three miles in circuit, communicating with each other by
narrow reedy straits : they are very shallow, none are above four or .
five feet in depth ; but abound with fish, such as Pike, Perch, Ruff,
Bream, Tench, Rud, Dace, Roach, Burbot, Sticklebacks and Eels.

It is observable, that once in seven or eight years, immense shoals
of Sticklebacks appear in the Welland below Spalding, and attempt
coming up the river in form of a vast column, They are supposed
to be the collected multitudes washed out of the fens by the floods
of several years, and carried into some deep hole ; when over-charged

with numbers, they are obliged to attempt a change of place.
They move up the river in fuch quantities as to enable aman, who
was employed in taking them, to earn, for a confiderable time, four
*  fhillings a day, by felling them at a halfpenny per bushel, They
were ufed to manure land, and attempts have been made to get oil
from them. The fen is covered with reeds, the harveft of the
neighboring inhabitants, who mow them annually ; for they prove
a much better thatch than ftraw, and not only cottages, but many
very good houses are covered with them. Stares, which during
winter refort in myriads to rooft in the reeds, are very deftructive,
by breaking them down, by the vaft numbers that perch on them.
"The people are therefore very diligent in their attempts to drive
them away, and are at great expence in powder to free themfelves of
these troublesome guests. I have seen a ftock of reeds harvested
and stacked worth two or three hundred pounds, which was the
property of a single farmer.
The birds which inhabit the different fens are very numerous : I
| never met with a finer field for the Zoologift to range in. Besides
the common Wild-duck, of which an account is given in another
place *, wild Geese, Garganies, Pochards, Shovelers, and Teals,.
breed here. I have seen in the Eaft Fen a small flock of the tufted
Ducks; but they seemed to make it only a baiting place. The
Pewit Gulls and black Terns abound; the last in vast flocks almest
deafen one with their clamors : a few of the great Terns, or Tickets, .
are seen among them. I saw several of the great crested Grebes on

the Eaft Fen, called there Gaunts, and met with one of their floating
nefts with eggs init. The leffer crefted Grebe, the black and dufky
Grebe, and the little Grebe, are alfo inhabitants of the fens ; roge- ;
ther with Coots, Water-hens, fpotted Water-hens, Water-rails,
Ruffs, Redfhanks, Lapwings or Wipes, Red-breafted Godwits and
Whimbrels. The Godwits breed near Wafhenbrough , the Whim-
brels only appear for about a fortnight in May near Spalding, and
then quit the country. Opposite to Foffdyke Wash, during summer,
are great numbers of Avosettas, called there Yelpers, from their cry :
they hover over the sportsman's head like the Lapwing, and fly with
their necks and legs extended.
Knots are taken in nets along the shores near Fofdyke in great
numbers during winter ; but they disappear in the spring. .
The fhort-eared Owl, Br. Zool. I. No. 66. visits the neighborhood
of Wafbenbrough along with the Woodcocks, and probably performs
its migrations with those birds, for itis observed to quit the country
at the same time : I have also received specimens of them from the
Danisþ dominions,. one of the retreats of the Woodcock. This owl -
is not observed in this country to perch on trees, but conceals itself
in long old grass; if disturbed, takes a short flight, lights again, and
keeps staring about, during which time its horns are- very visible,
The farmers are fond of the arrival of these birds, as they clear the 7
fields of mice, and will even fly in search of prey during day, provided.
the weather is cloudy and mifty.
But the greateft curiofity in thefe parts is the vaft Heronry at Hzroxey.
Greffi- Hall, six miles from Spalding. The Herons resort there in
February to repair their nests, settle there in the spring to breed, and
quit

14 A T O U R
quit the place during winter. They are numerous as Rooks, and
their nefts fo crouded together, that myself, and the company that
was with me, counted not less than eighty in one spreading oak. 1
here had opportunity of detecting my own miftake, and that of other
Ornithologists, in making two species of herons; for I found that
the crested Heron was only the male of the other : it made a most
beautiful appearance with its snowy neck and long crest streaming
with the wind, The family who owned this place was of the fame
name with these birds, which seems to be the principal inducement
for preserving them.
In the time of Michael Drayton,
Here stalked the stately crane, as though be march'd in war.
But at present this bird is quite unknown in our island ; but every
other species enumerated by that observant Poet still are found in
this fenny tract, or its neighborhood.
June 28. Visited Spalding, a place very much resembling, in form, neatness,
SPALDING. and situation,'a Dutch town: the river Welland passes through one of
the streets, assanal is cut through another, and trees are planted 
| ea h si e. The church is large, and the steeple a spire. The
churche. in general, throughout this low tract, are very handsome ;

In February 1642, Henrietta, the spirited consort of Charles I.

but coming soon after into the bay, brutally fired for two hours
at the house where she lay, forcing her to take shelter, half-dressed,
in the fields, Nor parlement nor admiral were ashamed of this
unmanly deed ; but their historian, the moderate Whitelock, seems
to blush for both, by omitting all mention of the affair. From —
hence is a fine view of the white cliffs of Flamborough-Head, .
which extends far to the East, and forms one side of the Ga-
brantuicorum sinus portuosus of Ptolemy, a name derived from the —
British Gyfr, on account of the number of goats found there,

The town is on the north fide; consists of about one hun-
dred and fifty small houses, entirely inhabited by fishermen, few
of whom, as is said, die in their beds, but meet their fate in '

direCtion of William Camidge, Cicerone of the place, who con- .
duéted me to a little creek at that time covered with fish, a
fleet of cobles having just put in. Went in one of those little
boats to view the Head, coasting it for upwards of two miles.
The cliffs are of a tremendous height, and amazing grandeur ;
beneath are several vast caverns, some closed at the end, others :
are pervious, formed with a natural arch, giving a romantic passage
to the boat, different from that we entered. In some places the
- rocks are insulated, are of a pyramidal figure, and soar up to a
vast height : the bases of most are solid, but in some pierced

Lay at Hunmandby, a small village above Filey Bay, round which

Filey Brig is a ledge of rocks running far into the sea, and often
fatal to shipping. The bay is sandy, and affords vast quantities of
fine. fish, such as Turbor, Soles, &c. which during summer ap-
proach the shore, and are easily taken in a common seine or

that prince, Henry II. rebuilt the fortress, then grown ruinous,

with greater strength and magnificence, inclofing a vast area.
From this time it was confidered as the key of this important
county, and none but perfons of the firft rank were entrufted
with the cuftody. Its confequence may be evinced from this
circumstance ; that when King John had granted to his fubjects
the Magna Charta, and placed the government in the hands of
twenty-five Barons, the governor of this castle was to be approved
by them, and to receive his orders from them. .

In 1312, Edward II. in his retreat out of the north before his
rébellious nobility, left here, as in a place of the greatest fecu-
rity, his minion- Peers Gavefton. It was instantly besieged, and |
taken by Aymer de Valence,. Earl of Pembroke, and the insolent
favorite, in a short time after, fell a victim to the resentment cf
the Earl of Warwick.

In the reign of Richard II. in 1378, its trade received great
injury from a combined fleet of Scots, French, and Spaniards, un-
der the conduct of one Mercer, who entered the harbour, and car-
ried off several ships. The insult was instantly revenged by
Philpot, a gallant alderman of London, who fitted out a fleet at
his own charge, pursued the enemy, and not only retook their
prizes, but made himself master of the whole fleet.

Richard III. added strength to the place by building a bul-
wark near the shore at the south-east end of the town; and he
also began to wall in the town*.

In the religious rebellion, styled the Pilgrimage of Grace, in
the time of Henry VIII. the leader, Robert Ak, in 1536, layed .

close siege to the castle; but was obliged to desist, after its.
governor Sir Ralph Ewers and his garrison were reduced for twenty
days to live on bread and water *.

In 1557, Thomas Stafford, fecond fon of Lord Stafford, with
only thirty-two perfons, came from France, and furprized the
fortress. It appears that they were encouraged to the attempt
by Henry II. It was, probably, only the prelude to an inva-
sion, Stafford published a manifesto against the Queen ; and styled
himself Prote&tor of England: but the Earl of Westmoreland, col-

lecting some forces, (in two days) put an end to his dignity +.

At the beginning of the civil wars, the parlement committed

. this castle to the care of Sir Hugh Cholmley, who soon after re-

, volted to the King. He maintained the place with great spirit
for two years. In 1644, he was vigorously besieged by Sir Fobx
Meldrum, from February till the middle of May, when Sir Fobn,
in attempting to repel a sally, received a mortal wound. Sir
Hugh kept possession of it till Fuly 1645, when he surrendered
= it on terms to Sir Matthew Boynton F. It is at present a large
‘ruin, In the castle yard are barracks for about a hundred and
fifty men, at present untenanted by soldiery,

Convenrs. In this town were three religious houses and a hospital. The
grey friers, or Franciscans began a house here about 1240, which
was enlarged by Edward II. and Roger Molendarius. The black

is doubtful. The white friers, or Carmelites, were eftablifhed here
in 1319, by Edward Il. and the Ciftertians had in the reign of ~
King Fobn a cell in this town, dependent en a house in France,
to which was given the church of St. Mary, and certain lands, ,
till the fuppreffion of the alien-priories in the reign of Edward
IV. Leland* describes this church as very magnificent; with
two towers at the weft end, and a great one in the centre, It ,
was probably demolished in the civil wars, when Sir John Mel-
drum forced the royalists into the caftle ; for it lay too near that
fortress to be suffered to remain entire, to give shelter to the
enemy. The present church (the only one in the town) rose from
the ruins of the former.
The town is large, built in form of a crescent, on the fides of ©
a steep hill; from whence the name, which fhews it to have *+
existed in Saxon times, Scaerburg, or the Burg on a Scar or cliff. ,
Beneath the south side of the castle, is a large stone pier (another is
now building) which shelters the shipping belonging to the place.
It is absolutely without trade, yet has above ten thousand inhze
birants, mostly sailors, and owns above three hundred sail of
ships, which are hired out for freight. In time of war govern-
ment seldom has less than a hundred in pay.
In 1359, the shipping of this place was very inconfiderable ; for,
to the naval armament of that year made by Edward III. Scarborough
contributed only x ship and 16 mariners ; when the following .
northern ports sent the numbers here recited :

The range of buildings on the Ckf commands a fine view of
the castle, town, and of innumerable shipping that are perpe-
tually passing backward and forward on their voyages. The

and the great conveniency of sea-bathing, occafion a vast resort
of company during summer ; it is at-that time a place of great
= gayety, for with numbers health is the pretence, but dissipation
the end,
The shore is a fine hard sand, and during low water is the place
where the company amuse themselves with riding. This is also
the fish market; for every day the cobles, or little fishing boats,
are drawn on shore here, and lie in rows, often quite loaden
with variety of the best fish, There was a fisherman on the gth
of May, 1767, brought in at one time, 20 cods, 14 lings, and 8
- holibuts, besides a vast quantity of leffer fish, and fold the whole for
1.  15s. It is superfluous to repeat what has been before men-
tioned of the methods of fishing, being amply described, Vol. III.

out the peculiar advantages of these seas, and the additional
benefit this town might experience, by the augmentation of its
fisheries, For this account, and for numberless civilities, I think
myself much indebted to Mr. Travis, surgeon, who communicated
to me the following Remarks :
© Scarborough is situated at the bottom of a bay, formed by
Whitby rock on the North, and Flamborough-Head on the South ;
the town is seated direétly opposite to the centre of the W. end of
the Dogger bank ; which end (according to Hammond's chart of
the North Sea) lies S. and by W., and N. and by E. ; but by a line
drawn from Tinmouth castle, would lead about N. W. and S. E.
Tho’ the Dogger bank is therefore but 12 leagues from Flamborough-
Head, yet it is 16 and a half from Scarborough, 23 from Whitby,
and 36 from Tinmouth castle. - The N, side of the bank stretches off
E. N. E. between 30 and 40 leagues, until it almost joins to the
Long-Bank, and Futt’s Riff. :
< It is to be remarked, that the fishermen seldom find any Cod, *
Ling, or other round fish upon the Dogger bank itself, but upon .
the sloping edges and hollows contiguous to it. The top of the
bank is covered with a barren shifting sand, which affords them no
subsistence; and the water on it, from its shallowness, is continually |
fo agitated and broken, as to allow them no time to rest. The
flat fish do not suffer the same inconvenience there ; for when dif- ;
turbed by the motion of the fea, they shelter themselves in the sand,
and find variety of suitable food. It is true, the Dutch fish upon
the Dogger bank ; bur it is also true they take little except Soles,
Skates, Thornbacks, Plaise, &c. It is in the hollows between the
E Dogger

26 A T o U R ©
Dogger and the Well-Bank, that the Cod are taken which supply
London market.

* The shore, except at the entrance of Scarborough pier, and
fome few other places, is composed of covered rocks, which abound
with Lobsters and Crabs, and many other shell fish ; (no Oysters)
thence, after a space covered with clean sand, extending in different
places from one to five or fix miles. The bottom, all the way to
the edge of the Dogger banks, is a scar ; in some places very rugged,
rocky, and cavernous; in others smooth, and overgrown with va- -

- * riety of submarine Plants, Moffes, Corallines, &c.* Some parts
again are spread with sand and shells ; others, for many leagues in —
length, with soft mud and ooz, furnished by the discharge of the
Tees and Humber.

* Upon an attentive review of the whole, it may be clearly
inferred, that the shore along the coast on the one hand, with the
edges of the Dogger bank on the other, like the fides of a decoy,
give a direction towards our fishing grounds to the mighty shoals of
Cod, and other fish, which are well known to come annually from
the Northern ocean into our seas ; and secondly, that the great va-
tiety of fishing grounds near Scarborough, extending upwards of 16
leagues from the shore, afford secure retreats and plenty of proper
food for all the various kinds of fish, and also suitable places for

each kind to depofite their spawn in.

< The fishery at Scarborough only employs 105 men, and brings
in about 52501. per annum, a trifle to what it would produce,

was there a canal from thence to Leeds and Manchester y it is pro-
bable it would then produce above ten times that sum, employ some
thoufands of men, give a comfortable and cheap fubfiftence to our
manufacturers, keep the markets moderately reafonable, enable our
manufacturing towns to underfell our rivals, and prevent the hands,
as is too often the cafe, raising insurreCtions, in every year of scarcity,
natural or artificial.”

On difcourfing with some very intelligent fishermen, I was in-
formed of a very singular phenomenon they annually observe about
the spawning of fish *®. At the distance of 4 or 5 leagues from -
shore, during the months of Fly and Auguf, it is remarked, that
at the depth of 6 or 7 fathom from the surface, the water appears
to be saturated with a thick jelly, filled with the Ova of fish, which
reaches 10-or 12 fathoms deeper : this is known by its adhering to
the ropes the cobles anchor with when they are fishing; for they
find the first 6 or 7 fathom of rope free from spawn, the next 10 or
12 covered with slimy matter, the remainder again free to the bottom.
They suppose this gelatinous stuff to supply the new-born fry with
food, and that it is also a protection to the spawn, as being disagree-
able to the larger fish to swim in. .

There is great variety of fifh brought on fhore. Befides thofe
described as Britifþ fish, were two species of Rays: the Whip-Ray
has alfo been taken here, and another species of Weever; but these
are fubjeéts, more proper to be referred to a Fauna, than an Itine- )
rary, for a minute defcription.

® Mr. Ofeeck observed the same in S. Laz. 35, 36, in his return from Chisa.

into pits and steeped in water, to extract all the faline particles,

precipitated by the addition of a solution of the /al sode, prepared

The alum works in this country are of some antiquity : they were
first discovered by Sir Thomas Chaloner, in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, who observing the trees tinged with an unusual color,
made him suspicious of its being owing to some mineral in the neigh-
borhood. He found out that the strata abounded with an alumi- .
nous salt.

At that time, the Engl/b being strangers to the method of manage
ing it, there is a tradition that Sir Thomas was obliged to seduce some
workmen from the Pope's alum-works near Rome, then the greateft

; in Europe. If one may judge from the curse which his Holiness
thundered out against Sir Thomas and the fugitives, he certainly was
not a little enraged ; for he cursed by the very form that Ernulphus®*
has left us, and not varied a tittle from that most comprehenfive of

The first pits were near Gi/borough, the seat of the Chaloners, who
ftill flourifh there, notwithftanding his Holinefs’s anathema. The
works were fo valuable as to be deemed a royal mine. Sir Paul
Pindar, who rented them, payed annually to the King 12,500'l., to
the Earl of Mulgrave 1,640 1., to Sir William Pennyman 600 1.; kept
800 workmen in pay, and fold his alum at 261. per tun. But this
monopoly was destroyed on the death of Charles I. and the right
restored to the proprietors.
In these alum rocks are frequently found cornua ammonis, and
other fossils, lodged in a stony nodule.. Jet is sometimes met with Jer.

The sands near Robin Hood's village, were covered with fish

others bufied in curing the fish; and. a little out at fea was a fleet

Wuitsy, called by the Saxons, Streanefbalch, or the bay of the
light-houfe, a large town, oddly fituated between two hills, with a

| narrow channel running through the middle, extending about a mile
farther up the vale, where it widens, and forms a bay. The two
parts of the town are joined by a good draw-bridge, for the con-
veniency of letting the shipping pass. From this bridge are often
taken the viviparous Blenny, whose back-bone is as green as that
of the Sea Needle, The river that forms this harbour is the Ef,
but its waters are very inconfiderable when the tide is out. Here
is a pretty brisk trade in ship-building ; but except that, a small
manufacture of fail-cloth, and the hiring of ships, as at Scarborough,
like that town it has scarce any commerce. It is computed, there
are about 270 ships belonging to this place, Of late, an attempt
has been made to have a share in the Greenland fishery ; four ships
were sent out, and had very good success. There are very good
dry docks towards the end of the harbour ; and at the mouth a most
beautiful pier. At this place is the first salmon-fishery on the
coaft.

In 1394 prodigious shoals of herrings appeared off this port,
which occafioned a vast refort of foreigners, who bought up,
cured the fish, and exported them, to the great injury of the na-
tives. To prevent which, the King iffued a proclamation, direed

On the hill above the S. side of the town is a fine ruin of St. Sr. Hitpa’s

Northumberland, about A. D. 657 ; poffibly in consequence of a :
vow he made to found half a dozen monasteries, and make his
daughter a nun, should heaven favor his arms. At this place :
was held, before King Ofwy, the celebrated controversy about the
proper season for keeping of Eafter. Archbishop Colman sup-
ported one opinion from the traditions, which the Britains had
of the example of St. John the Evangelist ; and Wilfrid, on the
contrary drew his arguments from the practice of St. Peter,
on whom the catholic church was founded, and to whom were

- committed the keys of heaven. O/wy demanded of Colman, whe-
ther this was true? who confeffed it was. © Then,” says his
majesty, © I will never contradi& the Porter of heaven, leaft I

Hilda founded a convent here for men and women, dedicated it
to St. Peter, and became the first abbess f. This establishment '
was ruined by the excursions of the Danes; but after the con- -
_ quest was rebuilt, and filled with Benedictines, by William de Percy, .
to whom the lordship was given by Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chefter,
nephew to the Conqueror. In lefs enlightened times it was believed
that not a wild goose dared to fly over this holy ground, and if it
ventured, was fure to fall precipitate and perifh in the attempt.

At the end of this moor, about three miles from Gi/borough, is a
beautiful view over the remaining part of York/ire, towards Dar-
ham, Hartlepool, and the mouth of the Tees, which meanders through
a very rich tract, The country instantly assumes a new face; the

of the county, The principal street is remarkably fine, being
165 feet broad; and several leffer streets run into it at right
angles. In the middle of the great street are neat shambles, a ,
town-house, and large affembly-room. There is besides a large
square, in which is a handsome Doric column thirty-three: feet
high. About a century ago, according to Anderfon, it had scarce
a house that was not made of clay and thatch; but is now a
flourishing place, having rose on the decay of trade at Yarum.
Its manufacture is a small one of sail-cloth; and great quanti-
tities of corn, and lead, (from the mineral parts of the country)
are sent off from hence by commission. As the river does not
admit of large vessels as high as the town, those commodities
are sent down to be shipped about three miles lower. The
port is a member of that of Newcastle, and has its custom-
house and proper officers. The town lies at the distance of
six miles from the bar; and the tide flows above eight miles
above the bridge.

Stockton was antiently a chapelry belonging to Norton, which
by length of time became ruinous, and too small for the in-
creasing inhabitants. In 1710, a new church was begun by
subscription; in 1712, it was consecrated by Bishop Crew; and,
in 1713, the place, by act of parlement, was made a diftin& .
parish from Norton.

says, that King John was entertained here by Bishop Poié#ers ,
and at this place figned the charter of Newcastle. Bishop Farn-
ham died here, in 1257. Bishop Kellow improved and made

- great additions to the castle : and here Bishop Morton took re-
fuge, when he fled from the Scots, in the beginning of the trou«
bles of Charles I. It was fold by order of parlement, in 1647,

one mile 68 chains from the coast : the most distant is about
seven or eight miles. They are rented for 16. per annum: their

tenant watches and shoots for the sake of the oil and skins. Some

their sides, and flat at their tops, and entirely covered with Guille-

made of fea plants; the upper part was formed of the down

rounded and warmly bedded: in fome were three, in others five
eggs, of a large fize, and pale olive color, as smooth and gloffy
as if varnifhed over. The nefts are built on the beach, among the
loofe pebbles, not far from the water. The Ducks fit very clofes
nor will they rife till you almoft tread on them, The Drakes

separate themselves from the females during the breeding season.
We robbed a few of their nests of the down, and after carefully
separating it from the tang, found that the down of one nest

north end of the isle is a deep chasm, from the top to the bottom
of the rock, communicating to the sea, through which, in tem-

After a few miles riding, have a full view of Berwick, and the

cession of this place, as one of the securities for the payment
of the ransom of William I. of Scotland, (according to the Poly-
chronicon of Durbam, quoted by Camden) the castle (now a ruin)
was built by Henry II. That politic prince knew the impor-
tance of this key to the two kingdoms. I imagine it had been
little understood before the reign of his illustrious prisoner : for .
about seventy years preceding, Edgar, one of his predecessors,

of England confirmed to it the privileges granted to it by Ed-

under its proper jurisdiction, till 1747, when legislature annexed

all private property, except those belonging to the Dean and Chap-

common rents of thofe are gol. a year, for which tenants
have as much fhore as ferves to launch out and draw their .
nets on fhore: the limits of each are staked ; and I observed
that the fifhers never failed going as near as poffible to their
neighbor's limits. One man goes off in a small flat-bottomed
boat, fquare at one end, and taking as large a circuit as his
net admits, brings it on fhore at the extremity of his boundary, |
where others affift in landing it. The best fishery is on the
south fide*: very fine salmon .trout are often taken here, which
come up to spawn from the sea, and return in the same man- .

way and the Baltic.

on the west, is Halydon hill, famous for the overthrow of the
Scots under the regent Douglas, by Edward III. on the attempt
of the former to raise the siege of the town. A cruel action

The time elapsed ; Seton refused to execute the agreement, and

The entrance into Scotland has a very unpromifing look; for
it wanted, for some miles, the cultivation of the parts more dif-
tant from England: but the borders were necessarily neglected ;
for, till the accession of ames VI. and even long after, the na-
tional enmity was kept up, and the borderers of both countries

, discouraged from improvements by the barbarous inroads of
each nation. This inattention to agriculture continued till late-
ly ; but on reaching the small village of Eytown, the scene was

stead ; the lands are inclofing, and yield very good barley,
oats, and clover; the banks are planting: I speak in the present
tense ; for there is still a mixture of the old negligence left
amidst the recent improvements, which look like the works of a
new colony, in a wretched impoverished country.
Soon after the country relapses ; no arable land is seen ; but
' for four or five miles succeeds the black joyless heathy moor of ;
Coldingham : happily, this is the whole specimen that remains of CoLDinonau, '
the many miles, which, not many years ago, were in the same
dreary unprofitable state. Near this was the convent of that name
immortalized by the heroism of its Nuns ; who, to preserve them-
selves inviolate from the Danes, cut off their lips and noses ; and
thus rendering themselves objects of horror, were, in 870, with
their abbess Za, burnt in the monastery by the disappointed
savages. In 1216, it was burnt again by King Fobn, in an in-
- road little less cruel.
This nunnery was the oldest in Scotland. For in this place the
virgin-wife, Etheldreda, took the veil in 670: But ‘by the antient
name, Coludum*, it should seem that it had before been inha-
bited by the religious called Culdees. After its deftruction by
the Danes, it lay deserted till the year 1098, when Edgar founded
on its fite a priory of Benedifines, in honor of St. Cuthbert, and
bestowed it on the monks of Durham, with all lands, waters,
wrecks, &c.+

are fome fhips fent annually from this place to Greenland, and the
exports of corn are pretty considerable, The harbour is safe, but
small; its entrance narrow, and bounded by two rocks. Between
the harbour and the caftle is a very surprising stratum of stone, in Corumnan ‘
some refpects resembling that of the Giants Causeway in Ireland : it Rocks,
consists of great columns of a red grit ftone, either triangular,
quadrangular, pentangular, or hexangular ; their diameter from one
to two feet, their length at low water thirty, dipping or inclining a
lictle to the south.
They are jointed but not fo regularly, or fo plainly, as those
that form the Giant's Causeway. The furtace of several that had |
. been torn off, appear as a pavement of numbers of convex ends,
probably answering to the concave bottoms of other joints once
incumbent on them, The space between the columns was filled
with thin septa of red and white sparry matter, and veins of the
same pervaded the columns transversely, This range of columns
faces the north, with a point to the eaft, and extends in front
about two hundred yards. The breadth is inconsiderable : the rest
of the rock degenerates into shapeless masses of the same fort of
stone, irregularly divided by thick septa. This rock is called by
the people of Dunbar, the Ifle. ~
Oppofite are the ruins of the caftle, feated on a rock above the
fea ; underneath one part is a vast cavern, composed of a black and
red stone, which gives it a most infernal appearance ; a fit repre-
fentation of the pit of Acheron, and wanted only to be peopled with :
witches to make the scene complete ; it appears to have been the

dungeon, there being a formed passage from above, where the poor
prisoners might have been let down, according to the barbarous
custom of war in early days. There are in some parts, where the
rock did not close, the remains of walls, for the openings are only
natural fifsures 3 but the founders of the castle taking advantage of
* this cavity, adding a little art to it, rendered it a most complete and
secure prison.
On the other side are two natural arches, through which the tide
| flowed ; under one was a fragment of wall, where there seems to
have been a portal for the admission of men or provisions from sea:
through which it is probable that Alexander Ramsay, in a stormy
. night, reinforced the garrison, in spite of the fleet which lay before
the place, when closely besieged by the Exg/A, in 1337, and gallantly
defended for nineteen weeks by that heroine black Agnes, Countess
. of March *. - ;
Through one of these arches was a most picturefque view of the
Bass Ie, with the sun setting in full splendor; through the other of
the May island, gilt by its beams.
Over the ruins of a window were the three legs, or arms of the
Ifle of Man, a lion rampant, and a St. Andrew's cross.

Near this town were fought two battles fatal to the Scots. |
The first in 1296 ; when the Earls of Surrey and Warwick, Ge-
nerals of Edward I. defeated the army of Bakol, took the castle,
and delivered the nobility they found in it to the Engh
monarch, who, with his usual cruelty, devoted them all to
death. ”
The other was the celebrated victory of Cromwel, in 1650;
when the covenanting army chose rather to fight under the di-
rection of the Ministers than the command of their Generals: +
and the event was correspondent. These false prophets gave the .
troops assurance of victory ; and many of them fell in the fight .

was once the ftate prifon of Scotland, is now neglected: it lies
clofe to the edge of the precipice, facing the little village of

for even in calmer weather it cannot be done without hazard, there
being a steep rock to ascend, and commonly a great swell, which

case of a false step, there is the chance of falling into a water almost
unfathomable.

geese, multitudes of which were then sitting on their nests near
the sloping part of the isle, and others flying over our boat:
it is not permitted to shoot at them, the place being farmed \
principally on account of the profit arising from the fale of

several other persons of rank : and the inscriptions on several of
their tombs are preserved by. Maitland. A gentleman informed me,
that some years ago he had seen the remains of the bodies, but in a
very decayed state : the beards remained on some; and that the

The students of the university are dispersed over the town, and

The students are liable to be called before the Profeffors, who
have power of rebuking or expelling them : I cannot learn that
either is ever exerted ; but, as they are for the mast part vo-

Kinross

IN SCOTLAND. 79
Kinross is a small town, seated in a large plain, bounded by
mountains ; the houfes and trees are fo intermixed, as to give
it an agreeable appearance. It has some manufactures of linnen
and cutlery ware. At this time was a meeting of juftices, on
a singular occasion : a vagrant had been, not long before, or-
dered to be whipped; but fuch was the point of honor among l
the common people, that no one could be persuaded to go to
Perth for the executioner, who lived there: to press, I may say,
two men for that service, was the cause of the meeting; so
Mr. Boswell may rejoice to find the notion of honor prevale in
as exalted a degree among his own countrymen, as among the vir-
tuous Corficans *. .
Not far from the town is the house of Kinross, built by the
famous archite& Sir William Bruce, for his own residence, and was
the first good house of regular architecture in North Britain. It is
a large, elegant, but plain building: the hall is fifty-two feet long ;
the grounds about it well planted; the fine lake adjacent; fo that —
it is capable of being made as delightful a spot as any in North v
Britain.
Loch-Leven, a magnificent piece of water, very broad, but
irregularly indented, is about twelve miles in circumference, and
its greatest depth about twenty-four fathoms : is finely bounded

nately disposed. Some islands are. dispersed in this great expanse

cattle: but the moft remarkable is that diftinguifhed by the capti-
vity of Mary Stuart, which stands almost in the middle of the
Locu-Levewn lake. The caftle still remains; consists of a square tower, a
CasTLE. small yard with two round towers, a chapel, and the ruins of
a building, where, it is said, the unfortunate Princess was lodged.
In the square tower is a dungeon, with a vaulted room above,
over which had been three other stories. Some trees are yet re-
maining on this little spot; probably coeval with Mary, under
whose shade fhe may have fat, expecting her escape at length
effected by the enamoured Douglas *®. This castle had before
- been a royal residence, but not for captive monarchs; having
been granted from the crown by Robert III. to Douglas, Laird of

Loch- Leven.
This castle underwent a siege in the year 1335; and the method
attempted to reduce it was of a most singular kind, Joby of
Sterling, with his army of Anghcised Scots, sat down before it;
; but finding from the fituation that it was impossible te succeed
in the common forms, he thought of this expedient. He stopped
up the water of Leven, at its discharge from the lake, with a
great dam, with stones, and every thing that would obstrat its
course, hoping by that means to raise the waters so high, as
to drown the whole garrison, But the watchful governor, Alan
de Vipont, took an opportunity of fallying out in boats when the

befiegers were off their guard; and piercing the dam, releafed
the pent-up waters, and formed a most destructive deluge on all
the plain below ; struck a panic into the enemy's army, put
them to flight, and returned to his castle laden with the spoils
of the camp *.
St. Serf’s ifle is noted for having been granted by Brudo, last
King of the Piés, to St. Servan and the Culdees; a kind of
priests among the first Christians of North Britain, who led a
sort of monastic life in cells, and for a considerable time pre-
served a pure and uncorrupt religion: at length, in the reign of
David 1. were suppressed in favor of the church of Rome. The

Ruusiine Brio. Brig at Glen-Devon, in the parish of Muchart, a bridge of one arch,
flung over a chafm worn by the river Devon, about eighty feet
deep, very narrow, and horrible to look down; the bottom, in
many parts, is covered with fragments ; in others, the waters are
vifible, gufhing between the ftones with great violence: the fides,
in many places, project, and almost lock in each other ; trees
fhoot out in various fpots, and contribute to encreafe the gloom
of the glen, while the ear is filled with the cawing of Daws,
the cooing of Wood-Pidgeons, and the impetuous noife of the
_ waters.

Cawopnon Lin, A mile lower down is the Cawdron Lin. Here the river, after
a short fall, drops on rocks hollowed in a strange manner into
' large and deep cylindric cavities, open on one fide, or formed
into great circular cavities, like cauldrons *: from whence the
name of the place. One in particular has the appearance of a
vast brewing-vessel; and the water, by its great agitation, has
acquired a yellow scum, exactly resembling the yefty working of
malt liquor. Just beneath this, the water darts down about
thirty feet in form of a great white sheet : the rocks below widen
considerably, and their clifty fides are fringed with wood. Be-
yond is a view of a fine meadowy vale, and the diftant mountains
near Sterling.

for the forests that once covered the country, are now entirely
destroyed. Formerly, from its darksome situation, this pile was
called the castle of Gloom; and all the names of the adjacent
places were suitable : it was seated in the parish of Dolor, was
bounded by the glens of Care, and washed by the birns of Sor-
row. The lordship was purchased by the first Earl of Argyle.
This castle, with the whole territory belonging to the family of
Argyle, underwent all the calamities of civil war in 1645; for
its rival, the Marquis of Montrose, carried fire and sword through
the whole estate, The castle was ruined, and its magnificent
reliques exist, as a monument of the horror of the times. No
wonder then that the Marquis experienced so woeful and igno-
minious a fate, when he fell into the power of so exasperated a
chieftain.

Returned to my inn along the foot of the Ochil hills, whose

of cattle and fheep. The country below full of oats, and in a

but moftly covered with fods; fome were covered both with
straw and fod. The inhabitants extremely civil, and never failed

of their houfes.

+ whofe estuary lies full in view ; the fea closing the profpeét on this
fide.
To the North lies the town of Perth, with a view of part
of its magnificent bridge; which, with the fine woods called Perth
Parks, the vast plain of Strath-Tay, the winding of that noble '
river, its islands, and the grand boundary formed by the distant
highlands, finish this matchless scene. The inhabitants of Perth
are far from being blind to the beauties of their river; for
with singular pleasure they relate the tradition of the Roman army,
when it came in sight of the Tay, bursting into the exclamation of,
Ecce Tiberim.
On approaching the town are fome pretty walks handsomely
Planted, and at a small distance, the remains of some works of
Cromwel’s, called Oliver's Mount.
Pertn is large, and in general well-built; two of the streets Peatn.
are remarkably fine; in fome of the leffer are yet a few wooden
houses in the old style; but as they decay, the magistrates pro-
hibit the rebuilding them in the old way. There is but one
parish, which has three churches, besides meetings for separa-
tits, who are very numerous. One church, which belonged to
a monastery, is very ancient: not a veftige of the last is now
to be feen; for the difciples of that rough apoftle Knox, made
a general defolation of every edifice that had given fhelter to
the worfhippers of the church of Rome: it being one of his
maxims, to pull down the nests, and then the Rooks would fly
away. .
The flourifhing ftate of Perth is owing to two accidents ;
the firft, that of numbers of Cromwel’s wounded officers and
foldiers

' soldiers chufing to reside here, after he left the kingdom, who
introduced a spirit of industry among the people: the other
cause was the long continuance of the Earl of Mar’s army here
in 1715, which occafioned vaft fums of money being fpent in
the place. But this town, as well as all Scotland, dates its protpe-
rity from the year 1745; the government of this part of Great
Britain having never been settled till a little after that time. The
rebellion was a diforder violent in its operation, but falutary in its
effects.

Travg. The trade of Perth is confiderable. It exports annually one
hundred and fifty thoufand pounds worth of linnen to different
places ; from twenty-four to thirty thousand bolls of wheat and
barley to London and Edinburgh, and about twelve or fourteen
thousand pounds worth of cured salmon, That fish is taken
there in vast abundance; three thousand have been caught in
one morning, weighing, one with another, sixteen pounds; the
whole capture, forty-eight thousand pounds. The fishery begins
at St. Andrew's Day, and ends August 26th, old style, The
rents of the fisheries amount to three thousand pounds per
annum.

I was informed that {melts come up this river in May and ~
Fune.

PzArL. There has been in these parts a very great fishery of pearl got
out of the fresh-water muscles. From the year 1761 to 1764,
10,0001. worth were sent to London, and fold from 10s. to 11. 16s.

33 grains. But this fishery is at present exhausted, from the avarice
of the undertakers: it once extended as far as Loch-T ay,

the frighted monarch James roared out of, and that he escaped
through, when he was faved from the fury of the populace, by
Baily Roy, a friend of Gowrie’s, who was extremely beloved in
the town. ° ,
From the little traditions preferved in.the place, it feems as
if Gowrie had not the left intent of murthering the King: on
the day his Majefty came to Perth, the Earl was engaged to
a wedding dinner with the Dean of Guild: when the account
of the King’s defign reached him, he changed color, on being
taken fo unprovided; but the Dean forced him to accept the
nuptial feaft, which was sent over to the Earl's house,
When the King fled, he passed by the feat of Sir William
Moncrief, near Earn-bridge, who happening to be walking out at
that time, heard from the mouth of his terrified majefty the whole
relation ; but the Knight found it fo marvellous and fo disjointed,
as plainly to tell the King, bat if it was a true flory, it was a very
Prange one. .
Gowrie was a most accomplished gentleman. After he had
finished his studies, he held the Professor of Philosophy's chair
for two years, in one of the Italian universities.

to be a most magnificent ftructure. The river here is very vio-

a hundred and twenty tons burthen come as high as the town ;
and if flat-bottomed, of even two hundred tons.
Sceny, Scone lies about a mile and half higher up, on the East bank
of the river. Here was once an abby of great antiquity*, which
was burnt by the reforming zealots of Dundee. The present pa-
lace was begun by Earl Gowrie; bur, on his death, being granted
by Fames VI. to his favorite Sir David Murray, of Gospatrie,
was completed by him; who, in gratitude to the King, has, in
several parts of the house put up the royal arms. The house is
built round two courts ; the dining-room is large and handsome,
has an ancient but magnificent chimney-piece, the King's arms,
with this motto,
Nobis hac invitla miserunt centum sex Proavi.
Beneath are the Murray arms. In the drawing-room is some good

Till the deftruétion of the abby, the Kings of Scotland were

transported to Weftminfter Abby, much to the mortification of the ,

they snatched from their oxen then at plough, first put a stop _

agreeable ideas; a traét of ground, which in 1732 was a mere
bog, but now converted into good meadows, and about fifty acres
covered with linnen; several other parts with buildings, and all

which are extremely pleafing, wafhed by the river, and com-
manding from different parts of the walks, the moft beautiful |
and picturesque views of wild and gloomy nature that can be
conceived. Trees of all kinds grow here extremely well ; and
even fo southern a shrub as Portugal laurel flourishes greatly. In
the garden are the ruins of the cathedral, once a magnificent
edifice, as appears by the beautiful round pillars still standing ;
but the choir is preserved, and at present used as a church.
In the burial-place of the family is a large monument of the
Marquis of Athol, hung with the arms of the numerous connections
of the family.
On the other side of the river is a pleasing walk along the
banks of the water of Bray *, a great and rapid torrent, full
of immenfe stones, On a rock at the end of the walk is a
neat building, impending over a most horrible chasm, into which.
the river precipitates itself with great noise and fury from a
considerable height. The windows of the pavillion are formed
of painted glass; some of the panes are red, which makes the
water resemble a fiery cataract. About a mile further is an-
other Rumbling Brig, like, but inferior in grandeur, to that near :
Kinross.
The town of Dunkeld is small, and has a small linnen manufacture, .
Much company resorts here, in the surrimer months, for the benefit of
drinking goats’ milk and whey: I was informed here, that those
animals will eat ferpents; as it is well known that ftags do.

After a ride of two miles along a narrow strait, amidft trees,
and often in fight of the Tay, was driven by rain into a fisher-
man’s hut, who entertained me with an account of his bufinefs:
| said he paid ten pounds per ann. for the liberty of two or
three miles of the river; fold the first fish of the season at
three-pence a pound ; after that, got three shillings per fish.
The houses in these parts began to be covered with broom, which
lasts three or four years: their infides mean, and very scantily fur-
. nished ; but the owners civil, sensible, and of the quickest ap-
prehensions.
- The strait now widens into a vale plentiful in oats, barley
and flax, and well peopled. On the right is the junction of
the Tay and the Tumel: the channels of these rivers are wide,
full of gravel, the mark of their devastation during floods, Due
north is the road to Blair and Fort Augustus, through the noted
pass of Killicrankie : turn to the left; ride opposite to Castle Men-
. zies: reach Taymouth, the feat of the Earl of Breadalbane.

affiduity in clearing it from stones, with which it was once covered,
A Blaster was in constant employ to blast the great stones with gun- -
powder; for, by reason of their size, there was no other method of
removing them,
The Berceau walk is very magnificent, composed of great trees,
forming a fine gothic arch; and probably that species of archi-
tecture owed its origin to such vaulted shades. The walk on the
bank of the Tay is fifty feet wide, and two and twenty hun-
dred yards long; but is to be continued as far as the junction
of the Tay and the Lion, which is about as far more. The first
runs on the sides of the walk with great rapidity, is clear, but
not colorless, for its pellucidnefs is like that of brown crystal ;
as is the case with most of the rivers in Scotland, which receive
their tinge frofn the bogs. The Tay has here a wooden bridge |
two hundred feet long, leading to a white feat on the side of
the opposite hill, commanding a fine view up and down Strath-
Tay. The rich meadows beneath, the winding of the river, the
beginning of Loch-Tay, the discharge of the river out of it, the
neat village and church of Kinmore, form a most pleasing and mag-
nificent prospect,
The view from the temple of Venus is that of the lake, with a Locu-Tar;
nearer sight of the church and village, and the discharge of the
river. The lake is about one mile broad, and fifteen long, bounded
on each side by lofty mountains ; makes three great bends, which
adds to its beauty. Those on the south are well planted, and

finely cultivated high up ; interspersed with the habitations of
the Highlanders, not singly, but in small groupes, as if they
loved fociety or clanship : they are very small, mean, and with-
out windows or chimnies, and are the disgrace of North Britain,
as its lakes and rivers are its glory. Loch-Tay is in many
places a hundred fathoms deep, and within as many yards of
© the shore, fifty-four.

Till of late, this lake was supposed to be as incapable of freezing
as Loch-Ness, Loch-Earn, and Loch-Each; tho’ Loch Rannoch, and
even Loch-Fine, an arm of the sea, often does. But in March 1771,
' so rigorous and uncommon was the cold, that about the 2oth of
that month this vast body, of water was frozen over, in one part,
from side to fide, in the space of a single night; and fo strong
" was the ice, as greatly to damage a boat which was caught in

it.
. Loch-Tay abounds with Pike, Perch, Eels, Salmon, Charr, and
Trout ; of the last, some have been taken that weighed above thirty
.. pounds. Of thefe fpecies, the Highlanders abhor Eels, and alfo
. Lampreys, fancying, from the form, that they are too nearly related

. to Serpents. ,
The North side is lefs wooded, but more cultivated. The
vast hill of Laxrs, with beds of snow on it, through great part
. of the year, rifes above the reft, and the still loftier mountain
of Benmor clofes the view far beyond the end of the lake. All
this country abounds with game, such as Grous, Ptarmigans*,
Stags, and a peculiar fpecies of Hare, which is found only

on the summits of the highest hills, and never mixes with the Wurrz Hare,
common kind, which is frequent enough in the vales * : is less
than the common Hare; its limbs more slender; its flesh more

. delicate: is very agile, and full of frolick when kept tame ; is
fond of honey and carraway comfits, and prognosticates a storm
by eating its own dung : in a wild state does not run an end,
but seeks shelter under stones as soon as possible. During
summer its predominant color is grey : about September it begins
to assume a snowy whiteness, the alteration of eolor appearing
about the neck and rump, and becomes entirely white, except
the edges and tips of the ears: in April it again resumes its
grey coat.
The Ptarmigans inhabit the very summits of the highest moun- Prazurcans,
tains, amidst the rocks, perching among. the grey stones, and
during summer are scarcely to be distinguished from them, by
reason of their color. They seldom take long flights, but fly ;
about like pigeons; are filly birds, and fo tame as to suffer a
stone to be flung at them without rising. It is not necessary
to have a dog to find them. They taste so like a Grous, as
to be scarce distinguishable. During winter, their plumage, ex-
cept a few feathers on the tail, are of a pure white, the color
of the snow, in which they bury themselves in heaps, as a protection
from the rigorous air.

fine winding walks on the South side of the hills, the great
beech sixteen feet in girth, the picturesque birch with its long
* streaming branches, the hermitage, the great cataracts adjacent,
and the darksome chasm beneath, I must enjoy over again
the view of the fine reach of the Tay, and its union with the
broad water of the Lion: I must step down to view the dru-

Taymouth is a large house, a castle modernized. The most
remarkable part of its furniture is the works of the famous
Fameson *, the Scotch Vandyck, an eleve of this family. That ' Jauzon.

Lochou ; but on the various ramifications, are the names of his
defcendents, and along the body of the tree are nine fmall
heads, in oval frames, with the names on the margins, all done
with great neatness; the second fon was first of the house of
Breadalbane, which branched from the other about four hundred
years ago. In a corner is inscribed, The Genealogie of the house
' of Glenorquhie Qubairof is descendit fundrie nobil & wortbie
houses. Jameson faciebat 1635. Its size is eight feet by five.
In the same room are about twenty heads of persons of the
family ; among others, that of a lady, fo very ugly, that a wag,
on seeing it, with lifted hands pronounced, that she was fear-
fully and wonderfully made. There are in the fame house, several
heads by Jameson ; but many of them unfortunately spoiled in the
repairing.

In the library is a small book, called, from the binding, the
black book, with some beautiful drawings in it, on vellum, of the
Breadalbane family, in water colors. In the first page is old Sir
Duncan, between two other figures ; then follow several chiefs of
the family, among whom is Sir Colin, Knight of Rhodes, who died
1480, aged 80. At the end is a manuscript history of the family,

ending, I think, in 1633.

The church is a remarkably neat plain building, with a very
handsome tower steeple. The congregation was numerous, de-
cent, attentive, still; well and neatly clad, and not a ragged or
flovenly perfon among them. There were two fervices, one in
English, the other in Erse. After the first, numbers of people,
of both sexes, went out of church, and seating themselves in
the church-yard, made, in their motly habits, a gay and pic-
turesque appearance. The devotion of the common people of HionLand

native indolence, very few beggars are feen in North Britain:
either they are full masters of the leflon of being content with a very
| little ; or, what is more probable, they are possessed of a spirit that
will struggle hard with necessity before it will bend to the asking of
alms.
' Visited a pretty island in Locb-Tay, tufted with trees, and not
far from the shore. On it are the ruins of a priory dependent on
_ that at Scone; founded in 1122, by Mexander the First ; in which
were deposited the remains of his Queen Sybilla, natural daughter to
Henry 1. : it was founded by Alexander in order for the prayers of
the Monks for the repose of his foul and that of his royal con-
sort *. To this ifland the Campbells retreated, during the fucceffes
of the Marquis of Montrose, where they defended themselves against
that hero, which was one cause of his violent resentment against the
whole name.

Jury 31. Rode to Glen-Lion ; went by the side of the river + that gives
name to it. It has now lost its ancient title of Due, or Black, given
it on account of a great battle between the Mackays and the Mac-

gregors; after which, the conquerors are said to have stained the
waters with red, by washing in it their bloody swords and spears.
On the right is a rocky hill, called Sh:-ha/len, or the Paps. Enter
Glen-Lion through a ftrait pass: the vale is narrow, but fertile ;
the banks of the river steep, rocky, and wooded ; through which
appears the rapid water of the Lion. On the North is a round

Saw at the house of Col. Campbell of Glen-Lion, a curious walking-
staff, belonging to one of his ancestors : it was iron cased in leather,
five feet long; at the top a neat pair of extended wings, like a cadu-
ceus ; but, on being shaken, a poniard, two feet nine inches long,
darted out.
He allo favored me with the fight of a very ancient brotche,
which the Highlanders use, like the fibula of the Romans, to fasten
their vest : it is made of silver, is round, with a bar cross the
middle, from whence are two tongues to fasten the folds of the
. garments: one side is studded with pearl, or coarse gems, in a very
rude manner; on the other, the names of the three kings of Cologne,
Caspar, Metcuior, BaLTAZaR; with the word confummatim.
It was probably a confecrated brotche, and worn not only for ufe, |
but as an amulet. Keyfler’s account of the virtues attributed to oe
their names confirms my opinion. He says'that they were written
on flips of paper in this form, and worn as preservatives against the .
falling-ficknefs :

repeated in the water. I must not omit that on the North side

of this lake is a most excellent road, which runs the whole

length of it, leading to Tiendrum and Inveraray, in Argylesbire,

and is the route which travellers must take, who make what I

call the petit tour * of Scotland. This whole road was made at

the sole expence of the present Lord Breadalbane; who, to fa-

cilitate the travelling, also erected thirty-two stone bridges over

the torrents that rush from the mountains into the lake. They

I was informed, that Lord Breadalbane’s estate was so extensive

that he could ride a hundred miles an end on it, even as far

as the West Sea, where he has also some islands. These great

properties are divided into distrits, called Officiaries : a ground

officer presides over each, and has three, four, or five hundred

&c. which they do, at their own expence, on horses backs, tra-
velling in strings, the tail of one horse being fastened by a cord,
which reaches to the head of the next : the horses are little, and
generally white or grey ; and as the farms are very small, it is com-
mon for four people to keep a plough between them, each furnish-

The north side of Loch-Tay is very populous; for in sixteen
square miles are seventeen hundred and eighty-fix souls : on the
other fide, about twelve hundred. The country, within these
thirty years, manufactures a great deal of thread. They spin with
rocks *, which they do while they attend their cattle on the hills;
and, at the four fairs in the year, held at Kinmore, above sixteen
hundred pounds worth of yarn is fold out of Breadalbane only :
which shews the great increase of industry in these parts, for less
than forty years ago there was not the lest trade in this article. -
The yarn is bought by persons who attend the fairs for that pur- .
pose, and fell it again at Perth, Glasgow, and other places, where it
is manufactured into cloth,

the chieftain; but much again is owing to the abolition of the

are remarkably fond of the Rubus Saxatilis, called in the High-
lands, on that account, the Roebuck Berry. When the ground
is covered with snow, they browze on the extreme branches of
the pine and juniper. They bring two young at a time: the
fawns elegantly spotted with white. It is extremely difficult to
rear them z commonly eight out of ten dying in the attempt.

The fiefh of the Roe is by fome accounted a delicacy: to

his estate restored, but in 1745 rebelling a second time, the country
was burnt, and the estate annexed to the crown. He returned a
few years after, and died as he lived, a most abandoned fot; not-
withstanding which, he had a genius for poetry, and left behind
him a volume of elegies and other pieces, in some of which

The belief in fpectres still exists ; of which I had a remarkable Srsctass,
proof while I was in the county of Breadalbane. A poor visionary,
who had been working in his cabbage garden, imagined that he
was raifed fuddenly into the air, and conveyed over a wall into an
adjacent corn-field * ; that he found himself surrounded by a crowd
of men and women, many of whom he knew to have been dead
some years, and who appeared to him skimming over the tops of the
unbended corn, and mingling together like bees going to hive: that
they fpoke an unknown language, and with a hollow found: that .
they very roughly pufhed him to and fro; but on his uttering the
name of Gop, all vanifhed but a female fprite, who feizing him by
the fhoulder, obliged him to promife an affignation, at that very
hour, that day fevennight : that he then found that his hair was all
tied in double knots, and that he had almoft loft the ufe of his
speech : that he kept his word with the fpectre, whom he soon faw
come floating thro’ the air towards him: that he fpoke to her, but

and relations of the deceafed, whom the old Dreamer had named,
were in the utmoft anxiety at finding them in fuch bad company in

In this part of the country the notion of witchcraft is quite lost :

Bar-ran, On the 1st of May, the herdsmen of every village hold their
 BSel-tein+, a rural sacrifice. They cut a square trench on the

ground, leaving the turf in the middle; on that they make a

fire of wood, on which they dress a large caudle of eggs, but-

ter, oatmeal and milk ; and bring, besides the ingredients of

the caudle, plenty of beer and whisky; for each of the com-

pany must contribute something. The rites begin with fpilling

some of the caudle on the ground, by way of libation : on that

posed preferver of their flocks and herds, or to some particular

animal, the real destroyer of them: each person then turns his

When the ceremony is over, they dine on the caudle; and after
the feaft is finished, what is left is hid by two persons deputed for
that purpose ; but on the next Susday they reaffemble, and finish the

 Lare-waxn, The Late-wake is a ceremony ufed at funerals. The evening =
after the death of any person, the relations and friends of the
deceased meet at the house, attended by bagpipe or fiddle; the
; nearest of kin, be it wife, son, or daughter, opens a melancholy
= ball, dancing and greeting, #. e. crying violently at the same
time; and this continues till -day-light; but with fuch gambols
and frolicks among the younger part of the company, that the
loss which occasioned them is often more than supplied by the
consequences of that night *. If the corps remains unburied
for two nights, the same rites are renewed. Thus, Scythian-like,
they rejoice at the deliverance of their friends out of this life
of misery.

mentions it in his Knight’s Tale.

It was my fortune to arrive at a certain town in Kerry, at the time
that a person of some distinction departed this life: my curiosity
led me to the house, where the funeral seemed conducted in the
purest classical form,

In short, the conclamatio was set up by the friends in the fame manner
as Virgil describes that consequential of Dido’s death.

Immediately after this followed another ceremony, fully described
by Camden, in his account of the manners of the ancient 1 ; the
earnest expostulations and reproaches given to the deceased, for
quitting this world, where she enjoyed so many blessings, so good a
husband, such fine children, This custom is also of great antiquity,

a numerous band of females waiting in the outer court, to attend the

admirably suited to the occasion : their robes were black and flow-

cataract, amidst most suitable scenery, about a mile distant from the -
house. —_—

This country is very mountanous, has no natural woods, except
of birch z but the vast plantations that begin to cloath the hills will
amply supply these defects. There is a great quantity of oats
raised in this neighborhood, and numbers of black cattle reared,
the resources of the exhausted parts of South Britain.

Visit the pass of Killicrankie, about five miles South of Blair: Kituicraniue,
near the Northern entrance was fought the battle between the
Viscount Dundee and General Mackay, in which the first was killed
in the moment of victory. The pass is extremely narrow between
high mountains, with the Gary running beneath in a deep, dark-
some, and rocky channel, over-hung with trees, forming a scene .
of horrible grandeur. The road through this strait is very fine,
formed by the foldiery lent by the Government, who have fix-
pence per day from the country, besides their pay. About a mile
beyond the pass, Mr. Robertson's, of Faskally, appears like fairy
ground, amidst these wild rocks, seated in a most beautiful meadow,
watered by the river Tumel, surrounded with pretty hills, finely -
wooded.

The Duke of Athol’s estate is very extensive, and the country
populous : while vaffalage existed, the chieftain could raise two or ,
three thousand fighting men, and leave sufficient at home to take
care of the ground. The forests, or rather chases, (for they are .
quite naked) are very extensive, and feed vast numbers of Stags,
which range at certain times of the year, in herds of five hundred.
Some grow to a great size: I have heard of one that weighed 18
stone, Scots, or 314 1b. exclusive of head, entrails and. skin. The

hunting,

120 A T O U R
. hunting of these animals was formerly after the manner of an
Great Eaftern monarch. Thousands of vaffals surrounded a great traé&
Huntincs. of country, and drove the Deer to the spot where the Chief-
tains were stationed, who shot them at their leisure. The mag-
nificent hunt, made by an Earl of thei, near this place, for
the amusement of Fames V. and the Queen-mother, is too re-
markable to be omitted ; the relation is therefore given as described
by Sir David Lindsay of the Mount *, who, in all probability, assisted
at it.
* The Earl of Athole, hearing of the King's coming, made
“* great provision for him in all things pertaining to a prince,
© that he was as well ferved and eased, with all things necef-
* sary to his estate, as he had been in his own palace of Edin-
, * burgh. For I heard fay, this noble Earl gart make a curious
<* palace to the King, to his Mother, and to the Embaffador,
“* where they were fo honourably eased and lodged as they had
been in England, France, Italy, or Spain, concerning the time
* and equivalent, for their hunting and pastime ; which was
* builded in the midst of a fair meadow, a fair palace of
«« green timber, wind with green birks, that were green both
| ' © under and above, which was fashioned in four quarters, and
* in every quarter and nuik thereof a great round, as it had
< been a block-house, which was lofted and gested the space
* of three house height; the floors laid with green scarets
«© spreats, medwarts and flowers, that no man knew where-
; ** on he zeid, but as he had been in a garden. Further, there

* were two great rounds in ilk side of the gate, and a great
< portculleis of tree, falling down with the manner of a bar-
* race, with a draw-bridge, and a great ftank of water of fix-
< teen foot deep, and thirty foot of breadth. And also this
** palace within was hung with fine tapestry and arraffes of silk,
* and lighted with fine glass windows in all airths; that this
< palace was as pleasantly decored, with all neceffaries per-

“ taining to a prince, as it had been his own palace-royal at ;
* home. Further, this Earl gart make such provision for the
* King, and his Mother, and the Embassador, that they had
* all manner of meats, drinks, and delicates that were to be
“ gotten, at that time, in all Scotland, either in burgh or land;
* that is to fay, all kind of drink, as ale, beer, wine, both

* white and claret, malvery, muskadel, Hippocras, aquavite. Fur p
© ther, there was of meats, wheat-bread, main-bread and ginge-
* bread ; with fleshes, beef, mutton, lamb, veal, venison, goose,
< grice, capon, coney, cran, swan, partridge, plover, duck,
* drake, briffel-cock and pawnes, black-cock and muir-fow],
© cappercaillies : and also the ftanks, that were round about
“ the palace, were full of all delicate fishes, as falmonds, trouts,
<< pearches, pikes, eels, and all other kind of delicate fishes,
that could be gotten in fresh waters; and all ready for the
* banket. Syne were there proper stewards, cunning baxters,
- * excellent cooks and potingars, with confections and drugs for
* their deserts ; and the halls and chambers were prepared with
< costly bedding, vessel and napery, according for a king, fo that
* he wanted none of his orders more than he had been at home
* in his own palace. The King remained in this wilderness,

“ at the hunting, the space of three days and three nights,
* and his company, as I have shewn, I heard men fay, it
« colt the Earl of Athole, every day, in expences, a thousand.
“ pounds.”

But hunting meetings, among the great men, were often. the
preludes to rebellion ; for under that pretence they collected.
great bodies of men without fufpicion, which at length occafioned
an act of parlement prohibiting such dangerous assemblies,

AvG. 3. Set out for the county of Aberdeen; ride Eaftward over a hill.

Gren-TiLT. into Glen-Tilt,, famous in old times for producing the most hardy.

warriors, is a narrow glen, feveral miles in length, bounded on.

each side by mountains of an amazing height; on the South is.

the great hill of Ben y glo, whose base is thirty-five miles in-

circumference, and whofe fummit towers far above the others.

. The sides of many of these mountains is covered with fine

verdure, and are excellent sheep-walks : but entirely woodless,
The road is the most dangerous and the most horrible I ever |

travelled: a narrow path, fo rugged, that our horses often were

obliged to cross their legs, in order to pick a secure place for

their feet; while, at a considerable and precipitous depth be-

7 neath, roared a black torrent, rolling through a bed of rock,,

folid in every part, but where the F#t had worn its ancient way..

Salmon: force their. passage even as high as this dreary stream, in-

fpite of the diftance from the fea, and the difficulties they have

to encounter.

Ascend a fteep hill, and find ourselves on an Arrie, or tra of.

a mountain which the families of one or two hamlets retire to with.
their flocks for pasture in summer. Here we refreshed ourselves
with.

with some goats’ whey, at a Sheekn, or Bothay, a cottage made of = Suretins,
gurf, the dairy-house, where the Highland shepherds, or graziers,
live with their herds and flocks, and during the fine feafon make
butter and cheefe. Their whole furniture confifts of a few horn-
spoons, their milking utensils, a couch formed of fods -to lie on,
and a rug to cover them. Their food oat-cakes, butter or cheese,

_ and often the coagulated blood of their cattle spread on their ban-
nocs. Their drink, milk, whey, and sometimes, by way of indul-
gence, whisky. Such dairy-houses are common to most mountanous
countries; those in Wales are called Hafodtai, or Summer-houses ;
those on the Swi/s Alps, Sennes.
_ Dined on the side of Loch-Tilt, a small piece of water, swarming
with Trouts. Continued our journey over a wild, black, moory, |
melancholy tract. Reached Brae-mar +; the country almost in- -
tantly changed, and in lieu of dreary wastes, a rich vale, plenteous
in corn and grass, succeeded. Cross the Dee near its head, which,
from an insignificant stream, in the course of a very few miles, in-
creases to the size of a great river, from the influx of numbers of
other waters; and is remarkable for continuing near fifty miles of
its course, from Jnvercauld to within fix miles of Aberdeen, without -
any fenfible augmentation. The rocks of Brae-mar, on the Eaft, Bran-wan,
are exceedingly romantic, finely wooded with pine. The cliffs are
very lofty, and their front most rugged and broken, with vast pines
growing out of their fissures.
On the North side of the river lies Da/more, distinguished by the Forest os
Finest natural pines in Europe, both in refpect to the size of the trees, DaLuonze -

and the quality of the timber. Single trees have been sold out of it
for fix guineas: they were from eighty to ninety feet high, without
' a lateral branch, and four feet and a half in diameter at the
lower end. The wood is very refinous, of a dark red color, and
very weighty. It is preferable to any brought from Norway, and
being sawn into plank on the spot, brings annually to the proprietor
a large revenue. On the opposite side of the river is the estate of
- Inverey, noted also for its pines, but of a size inferior to those of
Dalmore, When the river is swelled with rains, great floats of
timber from both these estates, are sent down into the Low
Countries,
This traét, abounding with game, was, in old times, the an-
nual resort of numbers of nobility, who assembled here to pass
a month or two in the amusements of the chace, Their hunt-
ings resembled campaigns ; they lived in temporary cottages,
called Lonqubards, were all dressed in an uniform habit con-
formable to that of the country, and passed their time with
jollity and good chear most admirably described by Fobn Taylor, the
water poet, who, in 1618, made there his Pennilesse Pilgrimage, and
describes, in page 135, the rural luxury with all the glee of a Sancho
Panga. |
« I thank my good Lord Erfin,” (says the Poet) © hee com-
© manded that I should alwayes bee lodged in his lodging, the
* kitchen being alwayes on the side of a banke, many kettles and
= < pots boyling, and many spits turning and winding, with great
“ variety of cheere: as venison bak’d, sodden, rost and ftu’de beefe,
| © mutton, goates, kid, hares, fresh salmon, pidgeons, hens, eapons,
** chickens, partridge, moore-coots, heath-cocks, caperkellies, and

® The French, during the reign of Charles IX. seemed not only to have made | \
full as large sacrifices to Digna and Bacchus, but even thought their entertainment
incomplete without the presence of Yexus. Jacques du Fouilloux, a celebrated writer
on hunting of that age, with much seriousness describes all the requifites for the
chace, and thus places and equips the jovial crew :—* L’Affemblée se doit faire
* en quelque beau lieu soubs des arbres aupres d'une fontaine ou Ruiffeau, 13
© ou les veneurs se doiuent tous rendre pour faire leur rapport. Ce pendant le
* Sommelier doit venir avec trois bons chevaux chargez d’inftramens pour arrouer
© fe gofier, comme coutrets, barraux, barils, flacons et bouteilles: lesquelles doiuent
© eftre pleines de bon vin d" Arbeis, de Beaume, de Chaloce et de Graue: luy eftant
© descendu du cheval, les metra refraischir en Veau, ou biens les pourra faire refro- |
* idir avec du Canfre: apres il estranda la nappe sur Ja verdure, Ce fait, le cuifi-
© nier gen viendra chargé de plufiers bons harnois de gueule, comme jambons, lan-
* gues de beeuf fumees, groins, oreilles de pourceau, cervelats, efchinées, pieces
* de beeuf de Saison, carbonnades, jambons de Mayence, pastez, longes de veau
© froides couaertes de poudre blanche, et autres menus fuffrages pur remplir le
* boudin lequel il metra fur la nappe.
© Lors le Roy ou le Seigneur avec ceux de fa table eftrendront leurs manteaux
* sur Pherbe, et se concheront de cofté deffus, beuuans, mangeans, rians et .
* faisans grand chere ;’ and that nothing might be wanting to render the enter-
tainment of such a set of merry men complete, honest Jacques adds, ‘et s’ily a
* quelque femme de reputation en ce pays qui faffe plaifir aux compagnons, elle
* doit etre alleguée, et ses passages et remuemens de feffes, attendant le rapport a
* venir.’

But to proceed.

Pass by the castle of Brae-mar, a square tower, the feat of the an-
tient Earls of Mar : in Jater times a garrison to curb the discontented
chieftains; but at present unnecessarily occupied by a company of
foot, being rented by the Government from Mr. Farquharson, of In-
wercauld, whose house I reach in less than half an hour.

Invercauld is seated in the centre of the Grampian hills, in.a fertile
vale, washed by the Dee, a large and rapid river : nothing can be
more beautiful than the different views from the several parts of it..
On the Northern entrance, .immense ragged and broken crags bound:
one side of the prospect ; over whose grey fides and summits is scat-
tered the melancholy green of the picturesque pine, which grows
out of the naked rack,. where one would think nature would have
denied vegetation.

A little lower down is the castle above-mentioned ; formerly a-
necessary curb on the little kings of the country ; but at present.
serves scarce any purpose, but to adorn the landscape..

The views from the skirts of the plain near Jpvercauld, are very
great ; the hillsthat immediately bound it are cloathed with trees,
particularly with birch, whofe lang and pendent boughs, waving a
vaft height above the head, furpafs the beauties of the weeping
willow.

The Southern extremity is pre-eminently magnificent ; the moun-
tains form there a vaft theatre, the bofom of which is covered with
extensive forests of pines : above, the trees grow scarcer and fcarcer,
and then seem only to sprinkle the surface ; after which vegetation '
ceases, and naked summits * of a surprising height succeed, many
of them topped with perpetual snow; and, as a fine contrast to
the scene, the great cataract of Garval-bourn, which seems at a
distance to divide the whole, foams amidft the dark forest, rushing

from rock to rock to a vast distance.

Some of these hills are supposed to be the highest part of Great
Britain: their height has not yet been taken, but the conjecture is

made from the descent of the Dee, which runs from Brae-mar + to
the sea, above seventy miles, with a most rapid course.

In this vale the Earl of Mar first set up the Pretender's standard
on the 6th of September 1715; and in consequence drew to destruc-

: tion his own, and feveral of the moft noble families of North
Britain.

excellent roads into a magnificent forest of pines of many miles ex- Ping Foruer,
tent. Some of the trees are of a vast size; I measured several that
were ten, eleven, and even twelve feet in circumference, and near
sixty feet high, forming a most beautiful column, with a fine verdant
capital, These trees are of a great age, having, as is supposed,
seen two centuries. Their value is considerable ; Mr. Farqubarson

. informed me, that by sawing and retailing them, he has got for .
eight hundred trees five-and-twenty shillings each: they are fawed
in an adjacent faw-mill, into plank ten feet long, eleven inches broad,
and three thick, and fold for two shillings apiece. .

Near this ancient forest is another, consisting of smaller trees,
almost as high, but very slender; one grows in a singular manner
out of the top of a great stone, and notwithstanding it seems to have
no other nourishment than what it gets from the dews, is above
thirty feet high.

The profpect above these forests is very extraordinary, a
distant view of hills over a surface of verdant pyramids of
pines.

I must not omit, that there are in the moors of these parts, what
I may call subterraneous forests, of the same species of trees, over-
thrown by the rage of tempests, and covered with vegetable mould.
These are dug up, and used for several- mechanical purposes. The
finer and more refinous parts are split into slender pieces, and serve
the purposes of torches. Ceres made use of no other in her search ‘

to get what they deem necessaries. The women are more in-

The Hill of Culbleen is the South-West extremity of a range
of mountains ‘which form a deep semicircle, and enclose on all
sides, except the South, a very fruitful bottom, and five parishes,

called Cromer. The foil, excepting some moors and little hills,
is good to the foot of the mountains, and produces the’ best
barley in the county of Aberdeen. Cromar is the entrance into
the Low Countries; the Er/e language has been disused in it

as Aberdeen, thirty computed miles, feems from this height as
a plain, and the profpect terminates in the German ocean. The
other great mountains appear to fink to a common fize; and
even Laghin y gair abates of its grandeur. About four miles
below Culbleen, at Charles-Town, ride on a line with the Hill of

It gives me real concern to find any historical authority for over-

ABERDEEN» ABERDEEN, a fine city, lying on a small bay, formed by the

Dee, deep enough for ships of two hundred tuns. The town is

about two miles in circumference, and contains thirteen thousand

souls, and about three thousand in the suburbs ; but the whole

number of inhabitants between the bridges Dee and Don, which

includes both the Aberdeens, and the interjacent houses or ham-

lets, is estimated at twenty thousand. It once enjoyed a good

share of the tobacco trade, but was at length forced to resign

it to Glasgow, which was so much more conveniently situated

for it. At present, its imports are from the Baltic, and a few

merchants trade to the Weft Indies and North America. Its exports

important article, as appears by the following state of it. For

this manufacture, 20,800 pounds worth of wool is annually im-

made 69,333 dozen pairs of stockings, worth, at an average 11. 10s.

ings manufactured from the waol of the county, which encourages

the breed of sheep much ; for even as high as Jnvercauld, the

farmer sells his sheep at twelve shillings apiece, and keeps them till

they are four or five years old, for the sake of the wool. About

200 combers are also employed constantly. The thread manu-

the woollen.

of trade : about 46 boats, and 130 men are employed on the first ;
and in some years 167,000 lb. of fish have been sent pickled to
London, and about 930 barrels of salted fish exported to France,
Italy, &c. The fishery on the Dox is far less considerable. About
the time of Henry VIII. this place was noted for a considerable
trade in dried cod-fish, at that period known by the name of Hab-
berdyn fish.

The town of Aberdeen is in general well built, with granite from
the neighboring quarries. The best street, or rather place, is the
Castle-street : in the middle is an o¢tagon building, with neat bas
relievos of the Kings of Scotland, from Fames I. to Fames VII. The
Town-houfe makes a good figure, and has a handsome spire in the -
centre.

The East and West churches are under the same roof; for the
North Britons observe economy, even in their religion: in one I
observed a small ship hung up ; a votive offering frequent enough in
Popish churches, but appeared very unexpectedly here. But I am
now satisfied that the ship only denotes the right the mariners have
to a sitting place beneath,

In the church-yard lies Andrew Cant, minister of Aberdeen, from Anvzzw Cant;
whom the Spectator derives the word to cant; but in all proba--
bility, Andrew canted no more than the rest of his brethren, for he
lived in a whining age *; the word therefore seems to be derived
from canto, from their singing out their discourses. The inscription
on his monument speaks of him in very high terms, styles him

founded by the citizens, and Mr. Richard Vaus, &c.: and a
. fourth of Carmelites, or White Friers, founded by Philip de Ar-
butbnot, in 1350. In the ruins of this was discovered a very: -
curious filver chain, fix feet long, with a round plate at one
end, and at the other a pear-shaped appendage; which is stil] pre-

The college was founded in 1494 by William Elpbinfton, Bishop
of this place, and Lord Chancellor of Scotland in the reign of
Fames UI.; and Lord Privy Seal in that of Fames IV. He
was a person of fuch eminence, that his cotemporaries firmly |
believed that his death was presaged by various prodigies, and
that supernatural voices were heard at his interrment, as if Heaven
more peculiarly interested itself in the departure of fo great a

The country now grows very flat; produces oats; but the

Reach

Bowness, or Buchaness, the seat of the Earl of Errol, perched,

like a Falcon's nest, on the edge of a vast cliff above the sea. The
drawing-room, a large and very elegant apartment, hangs over it;
the waves run in wild eddies round the rocks beneath, and the fea
fowl clamor above and below, forming a strange profpect and fin-
gular chorus. The place was once defensible, there having been
a ditch and draw-bridge on the accessible side; but now both are

. destroyed. .

Above five miles South is S/ains, the remains of the old fa- _
mily castle, seated strongly on a peninfulated rock ; but demo-
lished in 1594, by James VI. on the rebellion of the Earl of

Huntly. Near this place are some vast caverns, once filled with
curious ftalactical incruftations, now destroyed, in order to be
burnt into lime for there is none in this country, that useful com-
modity being imported from the Earl of Elgin's works on the Frith
of Forth.

through a noble natural arch, through which boats can pafs,
and lie fecure in this natural harbour. There is a path round
_ the top, but in fome parts too narrow to walk on with fatif-
faction, as the depth is about thirty fathom, with water on
both fides, being bounded on the North and South by {mall
creeks.
Near this is a great infulated rock, divided by a narrow and very
deep chafm from the land, This rock is pierced through midway
between the water and the top, and in violent storms the waves rush
through it with great noise and impetuofity. On the fides, as well
as those of the adjacent cliffs, breed multitudes of Kittiwakes*, Kittiwaxns.
The young are a favourite dish in North Britain, being served up a
little before dinner, as a whet for the appetite ; but, from the rank
smell and taste, seem as if they were more likely to have a contrary
effect. I was told of an honest gentleman who was fet down for
the first time to this kind of whet, as he supposed ; but after de-
molifhing half a dozen, with-much impatience declared, that he
had eaten fax, and did not find himself a bit more hungry than

Of late years, a very successful salmon fishery has been set up in
the sandy bays below Slains, This is performed by long nets,
carried out to sea by boats, a great compass taken, and then hawled
on shore. It is remarked, these fish swim against the wind, and

are much better tasted than those taken in fresh waters.

Moft of the labor on shore is performed here by the women:
they will carry as much fish as two men can lift on their shoulders,
and when they have fold their cargo and emptied their basket,
will re-place part of it with stones : they go sixteen miles to sell or
barter their fish ; are very fond of finery, and will load their fingers

with trumpery rings, when they want both shoes and stockings.

The land prospe& is extremely unpleasant ; for no trees will
grow here, in spite of all the pains that have been taken : not but
in former times it must have been well wooded, as is evident from
the number of trees dug up in all the bogs. The same nakedness
prevales over great part of this coast, even far beyond Bamff, except
in 2 few warm bottoms.
The corn of this tract is oats and barley; of the last I have seen
very good close to the edges of the cliffs. Rents are paid here =—_

but that with the town-house in it, adorned with a new spire, is
very handsome. This place was erected into a borough by virtue
of a charter from Robert II. dated Octob. 7. 1372, endowing it
with the same privileges, and putting it on the same footing with
the burgh of Aberdeen, but tradition says it was founded in the

. reign of Malcolm Canmore. . The harbour is very bad, as the en-

trance at the mouth of the Devron is very uncertain, [being often
stopped by the shifting of the sands, which are continually chang-
ing, in great storms ; the pier is therefore placed on the outside.

vanity: when visited by the great, she had all the parade of
officers, and gentlemen who attended : tables were spread, as if
there had been ample provision ; but the moment her visitors
were gone, the cloths were taken off, and her train fed with a

Not far from Cullen House are the ruins of the castle of Finlater,

fituated on a high rock, projecting into the fea. It was strengthened

in 1455 by Sir Walter Ogilvie, who had licence from Fames II. to
build a tower and fortalice at his castle of Finlater. It continued
in possession of the family till it was usurped by the family of the
Gordons ; but was restored to the right heirs about the year 1562,
by Queen Mary, who for that purpose caused it to be invested both
by fea and land.

The country round Cullen has all the marks of improvement,
owing to the * indefatigable pains of the late noble owner, in ad-
vancing the art of agriculture and planting, and every other useful
business, as far as the nature of the soil would admit. His success
in the first was very great; the crops of beans, peas, oats, and
barley, were excellent; the wheat very good, but, through the fault
of the climate, will not ripen till it is late, the harvest in these parts

being in OZober. The plantations are very extensive, and reach to
the top of Binz hill; but the farther they extend from the bottoms,
the worse they succeed,

The town of Cullen is mean; yet has about a hundred looms in
it, there being a flourishing manufacture of linnen and thread, of ©
which near fifty thousand pounds worth is annually made there and
in the neighborhood. Upwards of two thousand bolls of wheat,
barley, oats and meal are paid annually by the tenants to their
landlords, and by them fold to the merchants and exported : and

befides, the upper parts of the parifh yield peas, and great quanti-
ties of oats, which are fold by thofe tenants who pay their rents in

Near this town, the Duke of Cumberland, after his march from
Bamff, joined the rest of his forces from Strath-Bogie, and encamped \
at Cullen,

In a small sandy bay are three lofty spiring rocks, formed of flinty
masses, cemented together very differently from any stratum in the
country. These are called the three Kings of Cullen. A little far-
ther is another vast rack, pierced quite through, formed of pebbly
concretions lodged in clay, which had subsided in thick but regular
layers.

In this country are several Cairns or Barrows, the places of inter- Carnns.
ment of the ancient Caledonians, or of the Danes, for the method was
common to both nations. At Craig Mills near Glassaugh was a very
remarkable one demolished about fourteen years ago. “The dia-
meter was fixty feet, the height fixteen; formed entirely of ftones
brought from the fhore, as appears by the limpets, mufcles, and
other fhells mixed with them. The whole was covered with a layer
of earth four feet thick, and that finifhed with a very nice coat of
green fod, inclofing the whole. It feems to have been originally
formed by making a deep trench round the fpot, and flinging
the earth inwards: then other materials brought to complete
the work, which muft have been that of an whole army. On
breaking open this Cairn, on the summit of the stony heap be-
neath the integument of earth was found a stone coffin formed
of long flags, and in it the complete skeleton of a human body,
Jain at full length with every bone in its proper place: and with |

X them |

154 A T O U R
them a deer's horn, the symbol of the favorite amusement of the
deceased.
About five years ago another Cairn was broke open at Kil-hilleck,
or the hill of Burial, and in it was found another coffin about fix .
feet long with a skeleton, an urn, and some charcoal : a considerable
deal of charcoal was also met with intermixed every where among
the stones of the Cairn. By this it appears that the mode of inter-
ment was various at the same period ; for one of these bodies must
| have been placed entirely in its cemetery, the other burnt and the
ashes colle&ed in the urn.
A third Cairn on the farm of Brankanentim near Kil-billock, was
opened very lately ; and in the middle was found a coffin only two
feet square, made of flag-stones set on their edge, and another by way
of cover. The urn was seated on the ground, filled with ashes, and
was surrounded in the coffin with charcoal and bones, probably
bones belonging to the same body, which had not been reduced to
ashes like the contents of the urn.

, A fourth urn was discovered in a Cairn on the hill of Down,
overlooking the river Devron, and town of Bamff. This was also
placed in a coffin of flat stones, with the mouth downwards stand-

, ing on another stone. The urn was ornamented ; but round it were
placed three others, smaller and quite plain. The contents of each
were the same; ashes, burnt bones, flint arrow heads with almost

. vitrified surface, and a piece of flint of an oval fhape flatted, two
inches long, and an inch and a half thick. There was alfo in the
largeranges of shopsf the leffer, a small fender bone four inches.
long, and somewhat incurvated and perforated at the thicker end :

use, are unknown. —_—

The materials of the urns appear to have been found in the |
neighborhood ; and confist of a coarse clay. mixed with small
stones and sand, and evidently have been only dried, and not
burnt. By the appearance of the inside of the larger urn, it is
probable that it was placed over the bones while they were hot and
Full of oil; the whole inside being blackened with the steam ; and
where it may have been supposed to have been in contaé with them,
the stain pervades the entire thickness. The urn was thirteen inches
high.

The urn in the manner it was found ; the small bones ; and one '
of the arrow heads (of which no lefs than thirteen were found in the
greatest urn) are engraven from a fine drawing communicated to me

a mile South of Birkenbog, probably in memory of the flain
in the victory obtained in 988, by Indulphus, over the Danes.
The battle chiefly raged on a moor near Cullen, where there
are similar barrows ; but as it extended far by reason of the * re-
treat of the vanquished, these seem to be flung together with the
fame design.

Not far from these are two circles of long stones, called Gael-
cross : perhaps they might have been erected after that battle ; and
as Gaul is the Erfe word for a stranger or enemy +, as the Danes
were, I am the more inclined to suppose that to have been the fact.

Nor is there wanting a retreat of the inhabitants in time of war;

for round the top of the hill of Durn is a triple entrenchment
still very diftinét ; the middle of stone, and very strong in the
most accessible place : and such fastnesses were far from being
unnecessary in a tract continually exposed to the ravages of the
Danes.

The vault of the family of Abercrombies in this parish must not be
passed over in silence: it is lodged in the wall of the church, and
is only the repository of the sculls. The bodies are deposited in the
earth beneath ; and when the Laird dies, the scull of his predecessor

- 1s taken up and flung into this Golgotba, which at present is in pos-
- session of nineteen.
SUPERSTITIONS. Some superstitions still lurk even in this cultivated country, The
' farmers carefully preserve their cattle against witchcraft by placing
boughs of the mountain ash and honeysuckle in their cow houses

on the 2d of May. They hope to preserve the milk of their cows,
and their wives from miscarriage by tying red threads about them :
they bleed the supposed witch to preserve themselves from her
charms : they visit the well of Spey for many distempers, and the
well of Drachaldy for as many, offering small pieces of money and
bits of rags. The young people determine the figure and size of
their husbands by drawing cabbages blindfold on All-Hallows even;

- and like the Engh/h fling nuts into the fire; and in February draw
Valentines, and from them collect their future fortune in the nuptial
state.

Every great family had in former times its Damon, or Genius, -
with its peculiar attributes, Thus the family of Rothemurchus had

Near Forres, on the road-fide, is a vast column, three feet ten Great CoLvun,
inches broad, and one foot three inches thick : the height above
ground is twenty-three feet ; below, as it is said, twelve or fifteen. .
On one side are numbers of rude figures of animals and armed men,
with colors flying : some of the men seemed bound like captives.
On the opposite side was a cross, included in a circle, and raised a
little above the surface of the stone. Ar the foot of the cross are
two gigantic figures, and on one of the sides is some elegant fret-
work.

This is called King Sueno’s stone; and seems to be, as Mr. Gordon'®
conjectures, erected by the Scots, in memory of the final retreat of the
Danes : it is evidently not Danish, as some have asserted; the cross ,
disproves the opinion, for that nation had not then received the light
of christianity. , oo

On a moor not far from Forres, Boethius, and Shakespear from him,
places the rencountre of Macbeth and the three wayward fifters or
witches. It was my fortune to meet with but one, which was some-

far more dangerous than these, but neither withered, nor wild in ber

me he had seen an apple-tree so covered with it, in one season, as to
leave only a few of the green leaves of the upper branches appearing
above the surface. An estate of about 300 1. per ann. has been thus
overwhelmed ; and it is not long since the chimnies of the prin-

occasioned by the cutting down the trees, and pulling up the
bent, or ftarwort, which gave occasion at last to the act 15th G. IT.
to prevent its farther ravages, by prohibiting the deftruction of that

- fleet attended near the shore for the safety of his person, in case of a
defeat, immediately ordered them away, to convince his men of the
resolution he had taken of either conquering or perishing with
them.

The battle was fought contrary to the advice of some of the
most sensible men in the rebel army, who advised the retiring

- into the faftneffes beyond the Ness, the breaking down the bridge

of Inverness, and defending themselves amidst the mountains.

They politically urged that England was engaged in bloody wars

foreign and domestic, that it could at that time ill spare its

troops ; and that the Government might from that consideration,

be induced to grant to the insurgents their lives and fortunes,

on condition they laid down their arms. They were sensible

that their cause was desperate, and that their ally was faithless;

yet knew it might be long before they could be entirely subdued ;

® Regard to impartiality obliges me to give the following account very recently

' communicated to me, relating to the ftation of the chief on this important day ;
- and that by an eye-witnefs.

The Scorch army was drawn up in a fingle line; behind, at about soo paces
diftance, was acorps de referve, with which was the Adventurer, a place of feeming -
security, from whence he issued his orders. His usual dress was that of the High-
lands, but this day he appeared in a brown coat, with a loose great coat ever it,
and an ordinary hat, such as countrymen wear, on his head. Remote as this place
was from the spot where the trifling aQtion was, a servant of his was killed by an
accidental shot. It is well known how short the confli@ was: and the moment.
he saw his right wing give way, he fled with the utmost precipitation, and without
a fingle attendant, till he was joined by a few other fugitives.

Arderfier, instantly widens into a fine bay, and again as suddenly
contracts opposite Inverness, at. the ferry of Keffock, the pass into
Rossfhire. The town is large and well built, very populous, and
contains about eleven thousand inhabitants. This being the last
of any note in North Britain, is the winter residence of many of
‘the neigboring gentry: and the present emporium, as it was the
antient, of the north of Scotland, Ships of five or fix hundred
tons can ride at the lowest ebb within a mile of the town; and
at high tides vessels of 200 tons can come up to the quay.

to eight hundred hogsheads of porter are annually brought in.
The exports are chiefly salmon, those of the Ness being esteemed
of more exquisite flavor than any other. Herrings, of an in-

A in particular in 1222, from one Gillispie; in 1429, from Alexax-
der, Lord of the Isles; and, even fo late did the ancient manners
prevale, that a head of a western clan, in the latter end of the
last century, threatened the place with fire and sword, if they
did not pay a large contribution, and present him with a scarlet
suit laced ; all which was complied with.
On the North stood Qéver’s fort, a pentagon, whose form
remains to be traced only by the ditches and banks. He formed
it with stones purloined from the neighboring religious houfes. Ac
present there :is a very considerable rope-walk near it.
On an eminence south of the town is old Fort St. George, which
CasrLi. was taken and blown up by the rebels in 1746. It had been the
antient castle converted by General Wade into barracks. Ac-
cording to Boethius, Duncan was murdered here by Macbeth:
but according to Fordun, near Elgin*. This. castle used to be
the residence of the court, whenever the Scoztifh Princes were
called to quell the infu?rections of the turbulent clans. Old
people still remember magnificent apartments embellished with
stucco busts and paintings. The view from hence is charming
of the Firth, the passage of Keffock, the river Ness, the strange-
shaped hill of Tomman heurich, and various groupes of distant
mountains. |

* This is the last inflance of these frantic executions in the North of Scotland,
as that in the South was at Paisy in 1697, where, among others, a woman, young
and handsome, suffered, with a reply to her enquiring friends, worthy a Romaz
matron ; being asked why she did not make a better defence on her tryal, answered,
My perfecutors have deflroyed my honor, and my lift is not now worth the pains of de-
Fending. The last instance of national credulity on this head was the story of the
witches of Ther/o, who tarmenting for a long time an honest fellow under the

. usual form of cats, at lait provoked him so, that one night he put them to flight
with his broad sword, and cut off the leg of one less nimble than the rest; on his
taking it up, to his amazement he found it belonged to a female of his own species,
and next morning discovered the owner, an old hag, with only the companion leg
to this. The horrars of the tale were-confiderably abated in the place I heard ir,
by an unlucky enquiry made by one in company, wiz. In what part would the old
woman have suftered, had the man cut off the cat's tail ? But these relations of
almost obsolete faperftitions, must never be thought a refle€tion on this country, as
long as any memory remains of the tragical end of the poor people at Trizg, who,
within a few miles of our capital, in 1751, fell a facrifice to the belief of the com-

mon people in witches; or of that ridiculous impofture in the capital itself, in
1762, of. the Cock-Lane ghost, which found credit with all ranks of people.

above the ground as to form a considerable mount: on the
top was an extensive but shallow hollow: within were three low
concentric galleries, at small distances from each other, covered
with large stones; and the fide-walls were about four or five
feet thick, rudely made. There , are generally three of these
places near each other, fo that each may be seen-from any one.
Buildings of this kind are very frequent, along this coast, that
of Cathnefs and of Strathnavern. Others agreeing in external .
form are common in the Hebrides, but differ in their internal
conftruction. In the islands they are attributed to the Danes *
' here to the Piéfs. Poffibly each nation might have the fame
mode of building with some variation, for I am told that some
are to be seen in places where the Danes never penetrated.

The Ord was the ancient division of Cathness, when Sutherland was

dipt. I believe it to be the fame animal which in Sutherland is called”
the Water Mole.

Passed near the feat of a gentleman not long deceased ; the last

Sxcony Sicur. Who was believed to be possessed of the /econd fight. Originally he
made use of the pretence, in order to render himself more refpectable
with his clan; but at length, in spite of fine abilities, was made a
dupe to his own artifices, became possessed with a serious belief of
the faculty, and for a considerable number of years before his death
was made truely unhappy by this strange opinion, which originally
arose from the following accident. A boat of his was on a very tem-
pestuous night at sea; his mind, filled with anxiety at the danger
his people were in, furnished him with every idea of the misfortune
that really befell them : he suddenly starting up, pronounced that
his men would be drowned, for that he had seen them pass before
him with wet garments and dropping locks. The event was corre-
spondent, and he from that time grew confirmed in the reality of
spectral predictions.

There is another sort of divination, called Sleinanachd, or reading

the /peal-bone, or the blade-bone of a shoulder of mutton well
scraped. When Lord Loudon was obliged to retreat before the
Rebels to the isle of Skie, a common soldier, on the very moment
. the battle of Culloden was decided, proclamed the victory at that
distance, pretending to have discovered the event by looking
through che bone.

which was well attefted, and made much noife about the time
the prediction was fulfilled. A little after the battle of Preston
Pans, the president, Duncan Forbes, being at his house of Cul-
loden with a nobleman, from whom I had the relation, fell
into discourse on the probable consequences of the action: after a :
long conversation, and after revolving all that might happen, Mr.
Forbes, suddenly turning to a window, said, All these things may fall
out, but depend on it, all these disturbances will be terminated on this

an equal distance from shore) the form of the bay, and then regu-

SincLain Bay Went along a fine ‘hard sand on the edge of Sinclair bay. On the
ann CASTLE, South point, near No/s-bead, on the fame rock, are Sinclair and Ger-
, nigo caftles, but, as if the joint tenants, like beafts of prey, had
been in fear of each other, there was between them a draw-bridge ;
the firft too had an iron door, which dropped. from above through
grooves still visible : this was inhabited in the year 1603 by a Sin-
clair Earl of Cathne/s.
Should the chapel of St. Tayre near this castle exist, I overlooked
, that scene of cruelty in 1478. The Keiths and the clan Gun had in
that year a feud ; but a meeting was fixed at this place for a recon-
ciliation : twelve horse were to convene on each fide. The Cruner,
or chief of the clan Gun, and his fons and neareft kinfmen arrived
y first, and were at their prayers in the chapel ; when their antagonists
arrived with twelve horses, but with two men on each horse, think-
ing that to bring no more than the stipulated number of horses was
_ No breach of agreement. These attacked the people in the chapel,
and put them all to death, but with great loss to their own party, for
the Cruner and his friends sold their lives dear. I mention this tale
_ to oppose the manners of the old Cathnefians to those of the present
hospitable and worthy race.

artificial. At this time was the hay harvest both here and about
Dunrobin: the hay on this rough land is cut with very short scythes,
and with a brisk and strong ftroke.. The country produces and ex-
- ports great quantities of oatmeal, and much whisky is distilled from
the barley: the great thinness of inhabitants throughout Cathne/s

sale. Great numbers of swine are reared here: they are short,
high-backed, long-bristled, sharp, slender, and long nosed ; have
long ereét ears, and most savage looks, and are feen tethered in
almost every field. The rest of the commodities of Cathne/s are
butter, cheese, tallow, hides, the oil and skins of seals, and the
feathers of geefe.

and preferved in the chaff in dykes, which are ftacks in fhape of

: At a small distance from Sinclair castle, near Staxigo creek, is a

white fish abound here; but the want of ports on this stormy
coast is an obstacle to the establishment of fisheries on this side the

Much lime-stone is found in this country, which when burnt

The last private war in Scotland was occasioned by a dispute re- -
lating to this county. The present Earl of Breadalbane's granfather
. married an heiress of Cathne/s: the inhabitants would not admit her :

title ; but set up another person in opposition. The Earl, accord-

ing to the custom of those ill-governed times, was to assert his right

by force of arms : he raised an army of fifteen hundred men; but

the numbers, like those under the conduct of Gideon, were thought

to be too great: his Lordship first dismissed five hundred ; after

that, another five hundred ; and with the remainder marched to the

borders of Cathne/s. Here he thought proper to add ftratagem to

force. He knew that the enemy’s army waited for him on the other

fide of the Ord. He knew also that in those days whifky was the

Neétar of Cathne/s : and in consequence ordered a ship laden with

that pretious liquor to pass round, and wilfully strand itself on the

shore. The direétions were punctually obeyed; and the crew in ,
a seeming fright escaped in the boats to the invading army. The

Cathne/ians made a prize of the ship, and indulging themselves

too freely with the freight, became an easy prey to the Earl, who

that before-mentioned, A cross is cut on some sticks, which, is

dipped in pottage, and the Thursday. before Easter, one of each .

1st of May, they are carried to the hill where the rites are celebrated,

all decked with wild flowers, and after the feast is over, re-placed

over the spots they were taken from; and this was originally styled
Clou-an-Beltein *,.or the split branch of the fire of the rock. These
. follies are now seldom practifed, and that with the utmost secrecy ;

for the Clergy are indefatigable in discouraging every species of
superstition.

In certain places the death of people is supposed to be foretold
by the cries and fhrieks of Ben/bi, or the Fairies wife, uttered along
the very path where the funeral is to pass; and what in Wales
are called corps candles, are often imagined to appear, and foretell
mortality.

Fair, he formally demands her of the father. The Lover and his

in-law by the hand, and then plights his troth, and the Fair-one is '
+ surrendered upto him. During the marriage ceremony, great care
is taken that dogs do not pass between them, and particular atten-
tion is paid to the leaving the Bridegroom's left-shoe without buckle
or latchet, to prevent witches * from depriving him, on the nuptial
night, of the power of loosening the virgin zone. As a test, not
many years ago a singular custom prevaled in the J/efern High-
lands the morning after a wedding : a basket was fastened with a
cord round the neck of the Bridegroom by the female part of the
company, who immediately filled it with stones, till the poor man
was in great danger of being strangled, if his Bride did not take
compassion on him, and cut the cord with a knife given her to use
at discretion. But such was the tenderness of the Caledonian spouses,
that never was an instance of their neglecting an immediate relief of
their good man,

dbeargnaich, and in the Scotch, Red Weems. This water is about
two miles and a half long, and half a mile broad, adorned with
two or three isles prettily wooded, Each side is bounded by hills
cloathed at the bottom with trees; and in front, at the distance
of thirty miles, is the great mountain of Karn-gorm, patched with
snow.

This place is called Starfonach-nan-gai’l, or the threshold of the
Highlands, being a very natural and strongly marked entrance
from the North, This is the feat of the Clan Chattan, or the Cran
M' Intoshes, once a powerful people: in the year 1915, fifteen hun- CuaTrane
dred took the field; but in 1745, fcarce half that number: like
another Absalom, their fair mistress was in that year supposed to
have stolen their hearts from her Laird their chieftain: but the se-
vereft loyalist must admit some extenuation of their error, in yield-
ing to the infinuations of fo charming a feducer.

Here is preserved the sword of James V. given by that monarch
to the captain of Clan Chattan, with the privilege of holding the
King's sword at all coronations ; on the blade is the word JESUS, :
That of the gallant Viscount Dundee is also kept here, The first
was a consecrated sword presented to Fames in 1514, by Leo X. °
by the hands of his Legate+. This ancient family was as re-
fpectable as it was powerful ; and that from very old times. Of
this the following relation is sufficient evidence. In 1341 a Monro
of Foulis + having met with some affront from the inhabitants of
Strathardule, between Perth and Athol, determined on revenge,
collected his clan, marched, made his inroad, and returned with a

large booty of cattle. As he passed by Mey-ball, this threshold

of the Highlands, the Mac-Intosh of 1454 sent to demand the

Stike Creich or Road Collop, being a certain part of the booty,

challenged according to an ancient custom by the chieftains for
| liberty of passing with it through their territories. Monro ac-
quiesced in the demand, and offered a reasonable share ; but not

less than half would content the chieftain of Clan Chattan : this

was refused ; a battle ensued near Kessock ; Mac-Intofh was killed ;

Monro lost his hand, but from that accident acquired the name of

Back-Lawighe : and thus ended the conflict of Clagh-ne-berey.

Boetbius relates, that in his time Inverness was greatly frequented

by merchants from Germany, who purchased here the furs of several

sorts of wild beasts *; and that wild horses were found in great

abundance in that neighborhood : that the country yielded a great

deal of wheat and other corn, and quantities of nuts and apples.
At present there is a trade in the skins of Deer, Roes, and other

beasts, which the Highlanders bring down to the fairs. There

happened to be one at this time : the commodities were skins, vari-
ous neceffaries brought in by the Pedlars, coarse country cloths,

cheese, butter and meal; the last in goat-skin bags, the butter
lapped in cawls, or leaves of the broad alga or tang; and great

quantities of birch wood and hazel cut into lengths for carts, &c.

which had been floated down the river from Loch-Ne/s.

The fair was a very agreeable circumstance, and afforded a most Hientany dx.
singular groupe of Highlanders in all their motly dresses. Their y
brechan, or plaid, consists of twelve or thirteen yards of a narrow
stuff, wrapt round the middle, and reaches to the knees: is often '
fastened round the middle with a belt, and is then called brechan-
fall; but in cold weather is large enough to wrap round the whole
body from head to feet ; and this often is their pnly cover, not only
within doors, but on the open hills during the whole night. Ir is ,
frequently fastened on the shoulders with a pin often of silver, and
before with a brotche (like the fibula of the Romans) which is some.
times of silver, and both large and extensive ; the old ones have very
frequently mottos.
The stockings are short, and are tied below the knee. The
cuaran is a sort of laced shoe made of a skin with the hairy side out,
but now seldom worn, The zruis were worn by the gentry, and
were breeches and stockings made of one piece.
The color of their dress was various, as the word breaccan im-
plies, being dyed with stripes of the most vivid hues : but they
sometimes affected the duller colors, such as imitated those of the :
Heath in which they often reposed : probably from a principle of
fecurity in time of war, as one of the Scotch Poets feems to in- |
finuate.

directing him on his way, or affording their aid in passing the dan--
gerous torrents of the Highlands: hospitable to the highest degree,

which often flows from the meaneft when left expected. Thro’ my
whole tour I never met with a single instance of national reflection !
their forbearance proves them to be superior to the meanness of re-
taliation : I fear they pity us; but I hope not indiscriminately.

-affronts, and revengeful of injuries. Are decent in their general
behaviour; inclined to superstition, yet attentive to the duties of
religion, and are capable of giving a most distin& account of the
principles of their faith, But in many .parts of the Highlands,
their character begins to be more faintly marked; they mix more
with the world, and become daily less attached to their chiefs: the
clans begin to disperse themselves through different parts of the
country, finding that their industry and good-condutt afford them
| better protection (since the due execution of the laws) than any
their chieftain can afford; and the chieftain tasting the sweets of
advanced rents, and the benefits of industry, dismisses from his
table the crowds of retainers, the former inftruments of his oppref-
fion and freakish tyranny. |
:HrionLanp Most of -the ancient sports of the -Highlanders, such as
‘Sronts. archery, hunting, fowling and fishing, are now disused :
those retained are, throwing the putting-ftone, or stone of
firength *, as they call it, which occasions an emulation who can
throw a weighty one the farthest. Throwing the penny-stone,
which answer to our coits, The /binty, or the striking of a ball of
wood or of hair: this game is played between two parties in a large
plain, and furnished with clubs; which-ever side strikes it first to

beautiful scenery, generally in woods of birch, or hazel, mixed
. with a few holly, whitethorn, afpin, afh and oak, but open enough
in all parts to admit a fight of the water. Sometimes the road was
ftrait for a confiderable diftance, and refembled a fine and regular

avenue; in others it wound about the fides of the hills which over-
hung the lake: the road was frequently cut thro’ the rock, which
on one side formed a folid wall; on the other, a fteep precipice.
In many parts we were immerfed in woods ; in others, they opened
and gave a view of the fides and tops of the vast mountains soaring
| above: some of these were naked, but in general covered with
wood, except on the mere precipices, or where the grey rocks de-
nied vegetation, or where the heath, now glowing with purple
blossoms, covered the surface, The form of these hills was very
- various and irregular, either broken into frequent precipices, or
towering into rounded summits cloathed with trees; but not fo
close but to admit a sight of the sky between them. Thus, for
* many miles, there was no possibility of cultivation; yet this tract
was occupied by diminutive cattle, by Sheep, or by Goats: the laft
were pied, and lived most luxuriously on the tender branches of the
trees. The wild animals that possessed this picturefque scene were
Stags and Roes, black game, and Grous; and on the summits,
white Hares and Ptarmigans. Foxes are so numerous and vora-
cious, that the farmers are sometimes forced to house their Sheep,

as is done in France, for fear of the Wolves*.

The North side of Loch-Ne/s is far less beautiful than the South.
In general, the hills are lefs high, but very fteep; in a very few
places covered with brufh-wood, but in general very naked, from
the fliding of the ftrata down their floping fides. About the mid-
dle is Castle Urquhart, a fortress founded on a rock projecting into U CarrLy
the lake, and was said to have been the seat of the once powerful RQUBART»
Cummins, and to have been destroyed by Edward I. Near it
-is the broadest part of the Loch, occasioned by a bay near the
- Castle,
Above is Glen- Morifton, and East of that Straith-Glas, the
. Chisolm's country; in both of which are forests of pines, where
that rare bird the Cock of the Wood is still to be met with; per- Cock or THE
haps in those near Castle Grant ? Formerly was common through- .
out the Highlands, and was called Capercalze, and Auercalze;, and '
in the old law-books, Capercally. The variety of the black game, >
mentioned by M. Briffon under the name of Cog. de Bruyere piquete,
was a mixed breed between these two birds; but I could not hear
that any at present were to be found in North Britain. Linnaus
has met with them in Sweden, and describes them under the title of
Tetrao cauda bifurca subtus albo punttata. At Glen-Moriston is a ma-
nufacture of linnen, where forty girls at a time are taught for three
the Bear exifted there at left till the year 1057, when a Gordon, for killing a fierce
Bear, was directed by King Malcolm III. to carry three Bears’ heads in his banner.

of the work; and in the five little poems on Night, compofitions of as many Bards,
every modern Britis beast of chace is'enumerated, the howling Dog’ and howling
Fox described ; yet the howling Wolf omitted, which would have made the Bard’s
night much more hideous.

‘months to fpin, and then another forty taken in: there are befides
fix looms, and all fupported out of the forfeited lands,

Above is the great mountain Meal Fourvounich, the firft land
failors make from the East fea.

I was informed that in that neighborhood are glens and cafcades
, of furprifing beauty, but my time did not permit me to vifit them.
Dined at a poor inn near the GeneraPs Hut, or the place where
| General Wade resided when he infpected the great work of the
roads, and gave one rare example of making the foldiery ufeful
in time of peace. Near is a fine glen covered at the bottom with
[ wood, through which runs a torrent rising Southward. The coun-
Try also is prettily varied with woods and cornefields.
Fatt or About a mile farther is the fall of Fyers, a vast catara&, in a
° darkfome glen of a stupendous depth; the water darts far beneath
the top thro’ a narrow gap between two rocks, then precipitates
above forty feet lower into the bottom of the chafm, and the foam,
like a great cloud of smoke, rises and fills the air. The fides of
this glen ate vast precipices mixed with trees over-hanging the wa-
ter, through which, after a short space, the waters discharge them-
selves into the lake. ;

About half a mile South of the first fall is another passing
through a narrow chasm, whose sides it has undermined for a con-
fiderable way : over the gap is a true Alpine bridge of the bodies of
trees covered with fods, from whofe middle is an aweful view of -

| the water rearing beneath.

At the fall of Fober the road quits the side of the lake, and is

. carried for some space through a small vale on the side of the river
Fyers, where is a mixture of small plains of corn and rocky hills.

Then fucceeds a long and dreary moor, a tedious afcent up the.
mountain See-chuimin or Cummin’s Seat, whofe fummit is of a great
height and very craggy. Defcend a fteep road, leave on the right
Loch-Taarf, a {mall irregular piece of water, decked with little
wooded istes, and abounding with Char. After a second steep
defcent, reach
Fort Augustus *, a small fortress, seated on a plain at the head of Forr Avaverys,
Loch-Ness, between the rivers Taarf and Oich , the last is confi-
derable, and has over it a bridge of three arches. The fort consists
of four baftions ; within is the Governor's house, and barracks for
400 men: it was taken by the Rebels in 1746, who immediately
deserted it, after demolishing what they could. ;
Lach-Ness is twenty-two miles in length; the breadth from one Locu-Nass.
to two miles, except near Castle Urquhart, where it swells out to
three. The depth is very great ; opposite to the rock called the
Horse shoe, near the West end, it has been found to be 140 fathoms.
From an eminence near the fort is a full view of its whole extent,
for it is perfectly strait, running from East to West, with a point to .
the South. The boundary from the fall of Fyers is very steep and
rocky, which obliged General Wade to make that detour from its.
banks, partly on account of the expence in cutting through fo
much folid rock, partly through an apprehenfion that in cafe of
a rebellion the troops might be deftroyed in their march, by
the tumbling down of ftones by the enemy from above: befides
® Its Er/e name is Kil-chuimin, or the burial-place of the Cummins. It lies on
the road to the Ifle of Skie, which is about 52 miles off; but on the whole way
there is not a place fit for the reception of man or horse.

, this, a prodigious arch must have been flung over the Glen of
Hyers.

Never yaBzis. This lake, by reason of its great depth, never freezes, and during.
cold weather a violent steam rises from it as from a furnace, Ice *
brought from other parts, and put into Loch-Ness, instantly thaws ;
but no water freezes sooner than that of the lake when brought
into a house. Its water is esteemed very falubrious; fo that
people come or send thirty miles for it: old Lord Lovat in par-

ticular made constant use of it. But it is certain, whether it
be owing to the water, or to the air of that neighborhood, that
for seven years the garrifon of Fort Augustus had not loft a single

man.
The fish of this lake are Salmon, which are in season from
Christmas to Midsummer, Trouts of about 2 1b. weight, Pikes
and Eels, During winter it is frequented by Swans. and other wild

| fowls.
' The greatest rife of water in Loch-Ness is fourteen feet, The
lakes from whence it receives its supplies are Loch-Oich, Loch-
Garrie, and Eoch-Quich: There is but very little navigation on
it; the only vessel is a gaNy belonging to the fort, to bring the
stores from the East end, the river Ness being too shallow for.

. navigation.

Irs acrraTions It is violently agitated by the winds, and at times the waves are
wn 1755+ quite mountanous. November ist,. 1755, at the same time as the
earthquake at Li/bon, these waters were affected in a very extraordi-
nary manner : they rose and flowed up the lake from East to West
with vast impetuosity, and were carried above 200 yards up the-
river Oich, breaking on its banks in a wave near three feet highs

then continued ebbing and flowing for the space of an hour : but at
eleven o'clock a wave greater than any of the rest came up the river,
broke on the North fide, and overflowed the bank for the extent of
30 feet. A boat near the General's Hut, loaden with brush-wood, -
was thrice driven ashore, and twice carried back again ; but
- the last time, the rudder was broken, the wood. forced out, and the °
boat filled with water and left on fhore. At the fame time, ‘a little
ifle, in a fmall loch in Badenoch, was totally reverfed and flung
on the beach. But at both thefe places no agitation was felt on
land.

Augustus : on the summit is an ancient fortress. The face of this CasrLe or-
rock is a precipice; on the accessible side is a strong dyke of loose  To*-Pown..
stones; above that a ditch, and a little higher a terrafs supported
° by stones: on the top a small oval area, hollow in. the middle:
round this area, for the depth of near twelve feet, .are a quantity of.
stones strangely cemented with almost vitrified matter, and in some
places quite turned into black scoria.: the stones were generally.
granite, mixed with a few grit-stones of a kind not found nearer.
the place than 40 miles. Whether this.was the ancient site of some
forge, or whether the stones which form this fortress * had been .
colleéted from the strata of some Vulcano, (for the vestiges of such. |
are said to have been found in the Highlands) I submit to farther. -
enquiry. .
From this rock is a view of Ben-ki, a vast craggy mountain

above Glen-Garrie’s country. Towards the South is the high
mountain Coryarich : the ascent from this side is nine miles, but
on the other the descent into Badenoch is very rapid, and not
above one, the road being, for the case of the traveller, cut
into a zig-zag fashion. People often perish on the summit of this
hill, which is frequently visited during winter with dreadful
storms of snow.
Serr. 2. After a short ride Westward along the plain, reach Loch-Oich, a
narrow lake; the sides prettily indented, and the water adorned
Guzn-Gareiz. with small wooded isles. On the shore is Glen-Garrie, the feat of
Mr. M*Donald, almost surrounded with wood, and not far diftant is
the ruin of the old castle. This lake is about four miles long;
the road on the South side is excellent, and often carried through
very pleafant woods.
Locn-Locar. After a small interval arrive on the banks of Loch-Locby, a fine
piece of water fourteen miles long, and from one to two broad.
The distant mountains on the North were of an immense height ;
those on the South had the appearance of fheep-walks. The road
is continued on the side of the lake about eight miles. On the op- .
Cameron or posite shore was Achnacarrie, once the feat of Cameron of Lochiel,
Locust. but burnt in 1746. He was efteemed by all parties the honefteft
and moft fenfible man of any that embarked in the pernicious and
abfurd attempt of that and the preceding year, and was a melan-
choly inftance of a fine underftanding and a well-intending heart,
over-powered by the unhappy prejudices of education. By his in-
fluence he prevented the Rebels from committing several excesles,
and even faved the city of Glasgow from being plundered, when
their army returned out of England, irritated with their difappoint-
ment,

IN SCOTLAND. 223
ment, and enraged at the loyalty that city had fhewn. The Pre-
tender came to him as soon as ever he landed. Lochiel feeing him
arrive in fo wild a manner, and fo unfupported, entreated him to ;
desist from an enterprize from which nothing but certain ruin could
result to him and his partizans. The adventurer grew warm, and ©
reproached Lochiel with a breach of promise. This affe&ted him fo
deeply, that he instantly went and took a tender and moving leave
of his lady and family, imagining he was on the point of parting
with them for ever. The income of his estate was at that time, as
I was told, not above 7001. per annum, yet he brought fourteen
hundred men into the field.
The waters of this lake form the river Lochy, and discharge
themselves into the Western sea, as those of Loch-Oich do through
-  Loch-Nefs into the Eastern, About the beginning of this lake
‘enter Lochaber * ; stop at Low-bridge, a poor house; travel overa LFocuanun;

High-bridge, a fine bridge of three arches flung over the torrent
Spean, founded on rocks ; two of the arches are 95 feet high, This *©
bridge was buile by General Fade, in order to form a communica-
tion with the country. These public works were at first very dis-
agreeable to the old Chieftains, and lessened their influence greatly ;.
for by admitting strangers. among them, their clans were taught
that the Lairds were not the first of men. Bur they had another
xeafon much more solid : Lochaber had been a den of thieves ; and

as long as they had their waters, their torrents and their bogs, in a
state of nature, they made their excursions, could plunder and re-
treat with their booty in full security. So weak were the laws in
many parts of North Britain, till after the late rebellion, that no
stop could be put to this infamous practice. A contribution, call-
'BLacr-urale -ed the Black-meal, was raised by several of these plundering chief-
tains over a vast extent of country : whoever paid it had their
.cattle ensured, but those who dared to refuse were sure to suffer.
Many of these free-booters were wont to infert an article, by which
. they were to be released from their agreement, in case of any civil
commotion : thus, at the breaking out of the last rebellion, a
M'Gregor *, who had with the ftricieft honor (till that event)
preserved his friends’ cattle, inimediately sent them word, that from
that time they were out of his protection, and must now take care
of themselves. Barrisdale was another of this class, chief of a band
‘ -of robbers, who spread terror over the whole country: but the
Highlanders at that time efteemed the open theft of cattle, or the
making a creach (as they call it) by no means dishonorable; and
the young men confidered it as a piece of gallantry, by which they
recommended themselves to their miftreffes. On the other fide
there was often as much bravery in the purfuers; for frequent
battles enfued, and much blood has been fpilt on thefe occafions.
They alfo fhewed great dexterity in tracing the robbers, not only
through the boggy land, but over the firmeft ground, and even
over places where other cattle had paffed, knowing well how to
diftinguifh the fteps of thofe that were wandering about from thofe
, that were driven haftily away by the Free-booters,

From the road had a distant view of the mountains of Arisatg,
beyond which were Moydart, Kinloch, &c. At the end of Loch-
Shiel the Pretender first fet up his standard in the wildest place that
imagination can frame: and in this sequestered spot, amidst antient
prejudices, and prevaling ignorance of the blessings of our happy
constitution, the strength of the rebellion lay.
Pass by the side of the river Lochy, now considerable, See
Inverlochy Castle, with large round. towers, which, by the mode Invaiocur.
of building, seems to have been the work of the English, in
the time of Edward I. who laid large fines on the Scotch Barons
for the purpose of erecting new castles, The largest of
these towers is called, Cummin's. But long prior to these ruins
Inverlocky had been a place of great note, a most opulent city,
remarkable for the vast refort of French and Spaniards*, probably on
account of tradé. It was alfo a feat of the Kings of Scotland, for
. here Achaius in the year 790 signed (as is reported) the league l
offensive and defensive between himself and Charlemagne. In after-
. times it was utterly destroyed by the Danes, and never again re-
- ftored.
In the neighborhood of this place were fought two fierce
battles, one between Donald Balloch brother to Alexander lord of the
isles, who with a great power invaded Lochaber in the year 1427: .
he was met by the Earls of Mar and Cathness, the last was slain,
and their forces totally defeated +. Balloch returned to the isles
with vast booty, the object of those plundering chieftains, Here

gallant name. Fifteen hundred fell in the action, and in the
; purfuit, with the lofs only of three to the Royalifts. Sir Thomas
Oglevie the friend of Montrose died of his wounds. His death sup-
-  preffed all joy for the victory.

‘At Inverlochy is Fort William, built in King Wilkam’s reign ;
as was a small town near it, called Maryborough, in honor of
his Queen; but prior to that, had been a small fortress, erected
by General Monk, with whose people the famous Sir Ewen Cameron*
had numerous contefts. The prefent fort is a triangle, has two
baftions, and is capable of admitting a garrifon of eight hundred
men, It was well defended against the Rebels in 1746, who raised
the siege with much disgrace. It was also attempted by those of
1715, but without success. The fort lies on a narrow arm of the
fea, called Lochiel, which extends some miles higher up the country,

making a bend to the North, and extends likewise Westward towards
the isle of Mull, near twenty-four Scotch miles.

This fort on the West, and Fort Augustus in the centre, and:

Tus Cuaix. - Fort George on the East, form what is called the chain, from sea to
. fea. This space is called Glen-more, or the great Glen, which, in-

. cluding water and land, is almost a level of feventy miles. There
is, in fact, but little land, but what is divided by firth, loch, or
river; except the two miles which lie between Loch-Oich and Loch- ©
Lochy, called Lagan-achadrom. By means of Fort Gearge, all en-
trance up the Firth towards Inuerne/s is prevented. Fort Augustus.

Fort William is surrounded by vast mountains, which occasion
almost perpetual rain: the loftieft are on the South fide; Benevifb Buxzvien,

1450 yards. As an ancient Briton, I lament the disgrace of Syow-
don once esteemed the highest hill in the island, but now must
yield the palm to a Caledonian mountain. But I have my doubts
whether this might not be rivaled, or perhaps surpassed, by others
in the fame country; for example, Ben y bourd, a central hill,
from whence to the fea there is a continued and rapid descent of °° -
seventy miles, as may be seen by the violent course of the Dee to
Aberdeen, But their height has not yet been taken, which to be
done fairly must be from the sea. Benevish, as well as many others,
harbours snow throughout the year. .

_ _Travs or The great produce of Lochaber is cattle: that diftriét alone sends
Locnabmm out annually 3000 head; but if a portion of Inverne/s/bire is includ-
ed, of which this properly is part, the number is 10,000. There
are also a few horses bred here, and a very few sheep; but of late

several have been imported. Scarce any arable land, for the excef- 6
five wet which reigns here almoft totally prevents the growth of
corn, and what little there is fic for tillage sets at ten shillings an
acre. The inhabitants of this diftri€t are therefore obliged, for:
their fupport, to import fix thoufand bolls of oatmeal annually,
which cost about 4oool. ; the rents are about 3000]. per annum;
the return for their cattle is about 75001. ; the horses may produce
some trifle; so. that the tenants must content themselves with a very.

' scanty subsistence, without the profpect of faving the lest against
unforeseen accidents. The rage of raising rents has reached this:
distant country : in England there may be reason for it, (in a cer- _
tain degree) where the value of lands is increased by accession of
commerce, and by. the rife of provisions : but here (contrary to
all policy) the great men begin at the wrong end; with squeezing
the bag, before they have helped the poor tenant to fill it,. by the

introduction of manufactures. In many of the isles this already.
shews its unhappy effect, and. begins to depopulate the country;
for numbers of families have been obliged to give up the strong;
attachment the Scots in general have for. their country, and to ex-
change it for the wilds of America.

The houses of the peasants in Lochaber are the most wretched:
that can be imagined ; framed of upright poles, which are wattled ;
the roof is formed of boughs like a wigwam, and the whole is co-.

‘in the Highlands, being fo wild and uncommon that it never fails to
attract the eye of every stranger of the left degree of taste or fenfi-
bility. The entrance to it is strongly marked by the craggy moun-
tain of Buachal-ety, a little West of the King's house. All the other
mountains of Glen-Co resemble it, and are evidently but naked and
folid rocks, rising on each side perpendicularly to a great height
from a flat narrow bottom, so that in many places they seem to
hang over, and make approaches, as they aspire, towards each
other. The tops of the ridge of hills on one side are irregularly
| ; serrated for three or four miles, and shot in places into spires,
which form the most magnificent part of the scenery above Ken-
Loch-Leven, In the middle of the valley is a small lake, and from
it runs the river Cozy, or Cona, celebrated in the works of Offian.
Indeed no place could be more happily calculated than this for

forming the taste and inspiring the genius of such a poet.

ANIMAL. The principal native animals on the mountains of Glew-
Co are Red Deer, Alpine Hares, Foxes, Eagles, Ptarmigans,
and a few moor-fowl. It is remarkable that the common
Hare was never seen either here, in Glen-Creran, or Glen-Ety,
till the military roads were made. The Partridge is a bird but
lately known here, and is still rare. There are neither rats nor

vipers,
Farms. In Glen-Co are fix farms, forming a rent of 2411. per annum;
the only crops are oats, bear and -potatoes. The increase of oats
, is three bolls and a half from one; of bear four or five. But the
inhabitants cannot fubfift upon their harveft: about three hundred

Immediately after leaving Kinloch- Leven the mountains soar to a
far greater height than before ; the sides are covered with wood,
and the bottoms of the glens filled with torrents that roar amidst
the loose stones. After a ride of two miles begin to ascend the black
Tas BLack mountain, in Argyleshire, on a steep road, which continues about
MovunTain. three miles almost to the summit, and is certainly the highest pub-
lick road in Great Britain. On the other side the descent is scarce
a mile, but is very rapid down a zig-zag way. Reach the King's

Majesty's troops, in their march through this desolate country, but

is in a manner unfurnished.

pine wood on its fide. A few weather-beaten pines and birch ap-
pear scattered up and down, and in all the bogs great numbers of
roots, that evince the forest that covered the country within this
half century. These were the last pines which I saw growing spon-
taneously in North Britain. The pine forests are become very rare:

other road to the natives than the paths of fheep or goats, where
even the Highlander crawled with difficulty, and kept himfelf from
tumbling into the far-fubjacent water by clinging to the plants and
bufhes of the rock. Many of thefe rocks were too hard to yield
. to the pick-ax, and the miner was obliged to subdue their obstinacy
_ with gunpowder, and often in places where nature had denied him
footing, and where he was forced to begin his labors, suspended
from above by ropes on the face of the horrible precipice. The
. bogs and moors had likewise their difficulties to overcome; but
all were at length constrained to yield to the perseverance of our
troops. |
In some places, I observed, that, after the manner of the Romans,
they left engraven on the rocks the names of the regiment each
party belonged to, who were employed in these works ; nor were
they less worthy of being immortalized than the Vexillatio’s of the
Roman legions ; for civilization was the consequence of the labors
of both.
These roads begin at Dunkeld, are carried on thro’ the noted
pass of Killicrankie, by Blair, to Dalnacaydoch, Dakwhinie, and over
' the Coryarich, to Fort Augustus. A branch extends from thence
: Eaftward to Inverness, and another Westward, over High-bridge, to
Fort William. From the last, by Kinloch-Leven, over the Black

wilt give’ the place a very different appearance to what it now
bears.

From the top of the great rock Duniquaich is a fine view of
the castle, the lawn sprinkled with fine trees, the hills covered
with extensive plantations, a country fertile in corn, bordering on the
Loch, and the Loch itself covered with boats, The trees on the
lawn about the castle are said to have been planted by the Ear] of
Argyle : they thrive greatly ; for I observed beech from nine to
twelve feet and a half in girth, pines nine, and a lesser maple between
feven and eight.

But the busy scene of the herring-fishery gave no small improve-
ment to the magnificent environs of Inveraray. Every evening *
some hundreds of boats in a manner. covered the surface of Loch-
Fine, an arm of the sea, which, from its narrowness and from the
winding of its shores, has all the beauties of a fresh water lake : on
the week-days, the chearful noise of the bagpipe and dance echoes
from: on: board : on the sabbath, each boat approaches the land,
and pfalmody and devotion divide the day ; for the common people
of the North are disposed to be religious, having the example before
them of a gentry untainted by luxury and dissipation, and the ad-
vantage of being instructed by a clergy, who are active in their duty,
and who preserve respect, amidst all the disadvantages of. a narrow
income. |

The length of Loch-Fine, from the eastern end to the point of x,ocy-Fins. ©
Lamond, is above thirty Scotch miles ; but its breadth scarce two
measured : the depth from sixty to seventy fathoms. It is noted :

* The fishery is carried on in the night, the herrings being then in motion.

for:

240 A T o U R |
Henninoss for the vast shoals of herrings that appear here in Fuly and continue
till January. The highest season is from September to Chriftmas,
when near fix hundred boats, with four men in each are employed,
A chain of nets is used (tor several are united) of an hundred fathoms
in length. As the herrings {wia at very uncertain depths, fo the
: nets are funk to the depth the fhoal is found to take: the fuccefs
therefore dep:nds much on the judgment or good fortune of the
[ fishers, in taking their due depths; for it often happens that one
' boat will take multitudes, while the next does not catch a single
fish, which makes the boatmen perpetually enquire of each other
abour the depth of cheir nets. Thefe are kept up by buoys to a
proper pitch; the ropes that run through them fastened with pegs,
and by drawing up, or letting out the rope (after taking our the
pegs) they adjust their situation, and then replace them, Sometimes
the fish swim in twenty fathom water, sometimes in fifty, and often-
times even at the bottom,

It is computed that each boat gets about 4ol. in the season.
The fish are either salted, and packed in barrels for exportation, or
fold fresh to the country people, two or three hundred horses being

' brought every day to the water side from very distant parts. A
barrel holds 500 herrings, if they are of the best kind: at a medium,
700 : but if more, for sometimes a barrel will hold 1000, they
are reckoned very poor. The present price 11. 4s. per barrel;
but there is a drawback of the duty on falt for those that are
exported.

The great.rendezvous of veffels for the fishery off the western isles
is at Cambeltown, in Cantyre, where they clear out on the 12th of
September, aud fometimes_ three hundred busses are_seen there at a

time :

¢ime: they must return to their different ports by Fanuary 13th,
where they ought to receive the premium of 2 1. 10s, per tun of
herrings ; but it is faid to be very ill paid, which is a great difcou-
ragement to the fifhery. .
The herrings of Loch-Fine are as uncertain in their migration as
they are on the coast of Wales. They had for numbers of years .
quitted that water ; but appeared again there within these dozen
years. Such is the cafe with the lochs on all this western coast,
not but people despair too soon of finding them, from one or two —_—
unsuccessful tryals in the beginning of the season ; perhaps from
not adjusting their nets to the depth the fish happen then to swim in:
but if each year a small vessel or two was sent to make a thorough
tryal in every branch of the fea on this coast, they would undoubt-
edly find shoals of fish in one or other, ~

Two great headlands covered with trees separate the first scene
from one totally different; the last is called the Point of Firkin.
On passing this cape an expanse of water burfts at once on your
eye, varied with all the softer beauties of nature. Immediately be-
neath is a flat covered with wood and corn : beyond, the headlands
stretch far into the water, and consist of gentle risings ; many have
their surfaces covered with wood, others adorned with trees loosely
fcattered either over a fine verdure, or the purple bloom of the heath.
Numbers of islands are dispersed over the lake of the same elevated
form as the little capes, and wooded in the same manner ; others

[ One way is seen part of the magnificent lake, Ben-Lomond and the
vast mountains above Glen-Crow. On the other hand appears a fine
reach of the Clyde enlivened with shipping, a view of the pretty
seats of Roseneth and Ardincapel, and the busy towns of Port-Glasgow
and Greenock.
: Cross the ferry over the Levin at Bonnel, and after a ride of three
miles reach
Dunparton. Dunbarton, a {mall but good old town, seated on a plain near
the conflux of the Levin with the Firth of Clyde; it consists princi-
pally of one large street in form of a crescent, - On one side is the
Tolbooth, and at the South end the church with a small spire steeple;
it had been collegiate, was founded about 1450 by [abel Countefs
of Lenox and Dutchefs of Albany, and was dedicated to St. Patrick,
who was born in this county. The waites of the town are bag-
pipes, which go about at nine o’clock at night and five in the
morning.
Irs CasTLE. The castle is seated a little South of the town on a two-headed
rock of a ftupendous height, rising in a strange manner out of the
: sands, and totally detached from every thing else; is bounded on
one side by the Clyde, on the other by the Levin. On one of the
summits are the remains of an old light-house, which some suppose
to have been a Roman Pharos; on the other, the powder magazine :
in the hollow between is a large well of water fourteen feet deep.
The fides of the rocks are immenfe precipices, and often over-hang,
except on the side where the Governor's house stands, which is dev
fended by walls and a few cannon, and garrifoned by a few invalids.
It feems to have been often ufed as a ftate prifon: the Regent

strength, it was in former times deemed impregnable; fo that the
desperate but successful scalado of it in 1571 * may vie with the
greatest attempts of that kind, with the capture of the Numidian
fortress, in the Fugurthine war, by Marius; of the more horrible
surprize of Fe/camp +, by the gallant Bois-rosé.
The Britons in very early times made this rock a fortress; for
it was ufual with them after the departure of the Romans to retreat
to the tops of craggy inaccessible mountains, to forests, and to rocks
on the shores of the fea: but Boerhius makes the Scots possessed of it
fome ages prior to that, and pretends that it refifted all the efforts
of Agricola, who laid siege to it, It certainly may clame a right to |
great antiquity, for Bede declares it to have been the best fortified
city the Britons had during his days. Its ancient name was Alcluid,
or Arcluid, or the place on the Cluid. But in after-times it acquired
the name of Dun- Britton, being the last place in these parts held by
the Britons against the usurping Saxons. In 756, reduced by fa-
mine, it was surrendered to Edbert King of Northumberland.
From the fummit of this rock is a fine view of the country, of
the town of Dunbarton, the river Levin, the Firth of Clyde (the
Glota of Tacitus) here a mile broad, and of the towns of Greenock
' and Port-Glafgow, on the opposite shore, The business of this
country is the spinning of thread, which is very considerable.

nue about the same space of time as the Gilses : the fishermen call

them the young of some great Sea Trout. During May, Parrs

appear in such numbers in the Levin, that the water seems quite

animated with them. There are besides in that river, Perch and a
few Poans *.

are in general well built.

The market-places are great ornaments to this city, the fronts MarxeT-rpLaces,

of one or other of the orders. Some of these markets are tor meal,
greens, fish, or flesh,, There are two for the last which have con-
duits out of several of the pillars; fo that they are constantly kept
sweet and clean.

Near the meal-market is a publick granary, to be filled on any
apprehension of scarceness.

inhabitants, who regularly do duty. An excellent police is ob- °
ferved here, and proper officers attend the markets to prevent any .

The old bridge over the Clyde consists of eight arches, and was
built 400 years ago by Bifhop Rea: another is now built. The
tide flows three miles higher up the country ; but at low water is |
fordable. There is a plan for deepening the channel ; for at present
the tide brings up only very small vessels ; and the ports belonging
to this city lie several miles lower, at Port-Glafgow and Greenock, on
the side of the Firth. |

Near the bridge is a large alms-houfe, a vast nailery, a ftone-
ware manufacture, and a great porter brewery, which supplies some .
part of Ireland. Within fight, on the South fide, are collieries ; and

two deep wings at right angles with the centre, The gallery is of

great extent, and furnished (as well as some other rooms) with most

‘is a great performance. The fear and devotion of the Prophet is

his swelling muscles, and the violent extension of one foot : a Lion

STERLING... Sterling and its castle, in refpect of situation, is a miniature of
Edinbargh ; is placed on a ridged hill, or rock, rising out of a plain,
having the castle at the upper end on a high precipitous rock.
. Within its walls was the palace of several of the Scotch Kings, a
- square building, ornamented on three sides with pillars resting on
grotesque figures projecting from the wall, and on the top of each.
pillar is a statue, seemingly. the work of fancy. Near it is the old
parlement houfe, a vaft room 120 feet long, very high, with a
"timbered roof, and formerly had a gallery running round the inside. .
Below the caftle are the ruins of the palace belonging to the Earls
of Mar, whofe family had once the keeping of this fortress. There -
are still the Erfine arms and much ornamental carving on parts of.
it. The town of Szerling is inclofed with a wall ;. the streets are ir-
regular and narrow, except that which leads to the castle. Here, .

the fea, fo frequent and fo large, as to form a multitude of moft
beautiful peninfulas ; for in many parts the windings approximate
so close as to leave only a little isthmus of a few yards. In this
plain is an old abby, a view of 4/loa, Clackmannan, Falkirk, the
Firth of Forth, and the country as far as Edinburgh. On the North,
the Ochzil hills, and the moor where the battle of Dumblain was
fought. To the Weft, the ftrath of Menteith, as fertile as the East- ,
ern plain, and terminated by the Highland mountains, among
which the summit of Bex-Lomond is very conipicuous.
The Sylva Caledonia, or Caledonian Forest, begun a little North
of Sterling, and passing through Menteith and Strathern, extended,
according to Boethius, as far as Athol on one fide, and Lochaber on
the other. It is very flightly mentioned by the antients *; but the
supposed extent is given by the Scottish historian.
Lie at Falkirk, a large ill-built town, supported by the great FaLrInL.
fairs for black cattle from the Highlands, it being computed that
24,000 head are annually fold here. There is also a great deal of
money got here by the carriage of goods, landed at Carron wharf,
to Glasgow. Such is the increase of trade in this country, that
about twenty years ago not three carts could be found in the town,
and at present there are above a hundred that are supported by their
intercourse with Glasgow.
In the church-yard, on a plain stone, is the following epitaph on
Fobn de Grabam, styled the right hand of the gallant Wallace, killed
at the battle of Falkirk in 1298 +:
* By Pliny, lib. iv. c. 16. and Eumenius, in his Panegyric on Conflaniius, c. 7.

Near this is another epitaph, occasioned by a second battle of
Falkirk, as disgraceful to the English as the other was fatal to the
Scots: the first was a well disputed combat; the last, a pannic on
both sides, for part of each army flew, the one West, the other
East, each carrying the news of their several defeats, while the to-
tal destruction of our forces was prevented by the gallant behaviour
of a brigadier, who with two regiments faced such of the rebels as

_ kept the field, and prevented any further advantages. The epitaph

I have very often mentioned fields of battle in this part of the
kingdom : fcarce a fpot has efcaped unftained with gore; for had

Carron iron-works lie about a mile from Falkirk, and are the Trox
greatest of the kind in Europe : they were founded about eight years FOUNDERIESs
ago, before which there was not a fingle houfe, and the country a
mere moor. At prefent, the buildings of all forts are of vast ex-
tent, and above twelve hundred men are employed. The iron is
fmelted from the stone, then cast into cannon, pots, and all forts of ,
utensils made in founderies. This work has been of great service
to the country, by teaching the people industry and a method of

Carron wharf lies on the Forth, and is not only ufeful to the

Oven, which the ingenious Mr. Gordon * supposes to have been a

standards : but, to the mortification of every curious traveller, this
matchless edifice is now no more; its barbarous owner, a Gothic
; knight, caused it to be demolished, in order to make a mill-dam

Mr. Gordon, it began at old Kirk Patrick on the Firth of Clyde, and
ended two miles West of Abercorn, on the Firth of Forth, being in
length 36 miles, 887 paces.
Passed thro’ Burrowsfoness, a town on the' Firth, inveloped in +
* smoke from the great falt-pans and vast collieries near it. The
town-house is built in form of a castle. There is a good quay,
much frequented by shipping ; for considerable quantities of coal
are sent from hence to London ; and there are besides some Greeenland
ships * belonging to the town.

Ride near Abercorn, «called by Bede the monastery of Abercurnig , -
of which no mention is made in the accounts of the Scotch religious
houses : nor has there been for many centuries the left remains;
for Buchanan says that none of any kind were to be met with even
in his time, except the ruins of a tower belonging to the Deugla/es.

Reach Hopeton-Houfe, the feat of the Earl of Hopeton ; a house HoyzTon-
begun by. Sir Wiliam Bruce, and finished by Mr, Adams: is the HOUSE, |
handsomest I saw in North. Britain: the front is enriched with pi-
lasters; the wings at some distance joined to it by a beautiful colo-
nade: one wing is the stables, the other the library, In the last
is a single piece of lead ore weighing five tuns, got out of his Lord-
ship's mines at the Lead-bills. |

® This year the whale-frshery began to revive; which for a few years past had
been. fo unfuccefsful, that several of the adventurers had thoughts of disposing of
their ships. . Perhaps the whales had till this year deferted those seas; for Marten,

«© of their place, or feafible of their own danger, do often change their har-

The great improvements round the house are very extenfive, but
the gardens are still in the old tafte: trees and fhrubs fucceed here
greatly ; among others were two Portugal laurels thirty feet high.
Nothing can equal the grandeur of the approach to the houfe, or
, the profpect from it. The fituation is bold, on an eminence, com-
manding a view of the Firth of Forth, bounded on the North by
the county of Fife, thé middle is chequered with iflands, fuch as
Garvey, Inch Keith*, and others; and on the South-East is a vast
command of East Lothian, and the terminating object the great co-
nic hill of North Berwick.
The whole ride from Sterling to Queen's Ferry (near Hopeton-
House) is not to be paralleled for the elegance and variety of its
profpects : the whole is a composition of all that is great and beau-
tiful : towns, villages, seats, and ancient towers, decorate each
bank of that fine expanse of water the Firth: while the busy scenes
of commerce and rural ceconomy are no small addition to the till
life. The lofty mountains of the Highlands form a distant but
august boundary towards the North-West; and the Eastern view
is enlivened with ships perpetually appearing or vanishing amidst
the numerous isles.
® This isle is opposite to Leith. By order of council, in 1497, all venereal pa-
tients in the neighbourhood were transported there, Ne quid detrimenti res publica
caperet, It is remarkable, that this disorder, which was thought to have appeared
in Europe only four years before, should make fo quick a progress. The horror
of a disease, for which there was then supposed to be no cure, must have occafion-
ed this attention to stop the contagion ; for even half a century after, one of the
first monarchs of Earepe, Francis I. fell a victim to it. The order is fo curious
that we have given it a place in the Appendix. 3

It was impossible not to recal the idea of what I had seen to ima-
gine the former condition of this part of the kingdom, and to com-
pare it with the present state, and by a fort of fecond-fight make a
probable conjecture of the happy appearance it will assume in a
very few years, Nor could I forbear repeating the prophetic lines * |
of Aaron Hill, who seemed seized with a like réverie.
Once more! O North, I view thy winding shores, :
Climb thy bleak hills and crofs thy dusky moors.
Impartial view thee with an heedful eye,
Yet still by nature, not by censure try.
England thy fitter is a gay coquet,
Whom art enlivens, and temptations whet:
Rich, prond, and wanton, she her beauty knows,
And in a confcious warmth of beauty glows:
Scotland comes after like an unripe fair, .
Who fighs with anguifh at her fifter’s air;
Unconscions, that he'll quickly have her day,
And be the toast when L£/bion's charms decay. '

that I had met with in the Highlands, I continued my journey
South, through a rich corn country, leaving the Pentland hills to ;
the Weft, whofe fides were covered with a fine turf. Before I
reached Crook, a small village, the country grew worse : after this
it assumed a Highland appearance, the hills were high, the vales
narrow, and there was besides a great scarcity of trees, and hardly .

About three miles farther cross the Z& over a handsome stone-
bridge, and lie at the small village of Loygtown. The country is
very rich in corn, but quite bare of trees, and very flat. Near this
village, at Netherby, are the ruins of a Roman station, where statues,

weapons and coins are often dug up.

I had not leisure to remark the several antiquities that Mr. Grabam
is possessed of : but out of them sele&t the following, engraven in
the annexed plate, and in the tail piece to the concluding page.

No. I. is a figure in a dress with close sleeves, not unlike in the
body to a carter's frock, or what Montfaucon calls sagum clausum *,
reaching down to the heels. On one side is a boar, on the other a
wheel, and beneath that an altar: in the left hand is part of a
cornucopia. The figure is evidently Gaul;fb, but the history is ob-
scure: the boar is often an emblem of Caledonia: the wheel a
known type of Fortune: it is also a concomitant of two Saxon
Deities +, of the idol of the Sun and of Seater; and I would chuse to
derive it from Germany or Gaul rather than from Rome. It seems a
* Deity of some barbarous nation, but it is a difficult task to assign it
to any one in particular. The Gauls and Germans were neighbors ;
they might in some instances have the same objeéts of worship. As '
the Roman armies were latterly composed of different Gaul and
foreign nations, their Deities were introduced and intermixed with
those of the Romans, a most superstitious people, ready and accuf-
tomed to adopt those of every country, We need not wonder at the
variety of figures found in this country, for it appears from an in-
scription t, that there had been at Cambeck, a Temple of every nation,
a latitudinarian Pantheon, fo that every religion enjoyed a liberty of
conscience, . .
I conjecture that this figure was the mater Dem, the mother of
the gods of some Gauiish or German nation, probably engraven after
their intercourse with the Romans, for there appears a mixture of

emblem. Cybele or the mother of the gods is often engraven with a
cornucopia: and Tacitus * mentions a Germay people that worshipped
this goddess, and ufed the boar as the emblem of their superstition :
which was an amulet, a charm against all dangers. They seldom
made use of iron weapons, but often of .clubs. It appears to me
that what rises above the boar is intended for an instrument of that
kind. The figure is deprived of its.head j I cannot pursue my com- +
parison with this deity any farther. .

No. 11. is-a fecond headless figure resembling the former, only
that a fort of short close mantle covers the shoulders and breast, It
has the wheel, altar, and coraucopia, but beneath the feet appear the

No. ILI. is a figure fitting in a chair (with large elbows), cloathed
in garments much plaited and folded: on. the lap are apples or
fruits. Nebalenmia, a Zeland goddefs, is represented in this attitude +,

- and her lap thus‘filled: the habit differs :- but this deity might have
been adopted by another. nation, whodresfed her according to its own.

without reason that the lap of the goddess is filled with it. -
Ne. IV. is a curious groupe of three figures standing with their
backs to a long seat with elbows. They are habited in a loose
sagum, or saic, as the Britons name it, reaching but little below the
knees : that in the middle is distinguished by a pointed flap, and a
vessel filled, whether with fruits. or corn is not very evident. These
may perhaps be the Dee matres of the barbarous nations, and
introduced here by some of the German levies ;. there having been
found in Britain three altars dedicated to them by the Tungrian
cohort. They were local deities, protectreffes of certain towns
and villages among the Gauls + and Germans, by whom they were
transported into Britain, which is acknowledged in two inscrip-
tions, where they are called transmarine. If they were rural.
deities, the contents of the cup is very apt. I may remark that .
the antients in general were fond of the number THREE ; and the
Gauls f are. known to groupe their deities very frequently in tri-
Plets ; a number the most complete, as it regards Beginning, Middle,
and End.

was of this nature ; the mockafins of the North American nations are
not much dissimilar : fo exactly does necessity operate in distant
I countries in producing the same inventions.

The 1st figure in the tail piece is dressed in its sagum. On the
right is a vessel standing on two high legs or supports. The figure
seems going to fling in what it holds in one hand : the other leans on

. something that resembles an ear of corn. This probably is a rural

The cathedral * is very imperfect, Cromwel having pulled down
part to build barracks with the materials. There remains some
portion that was built in the Saxon times, with very masly pillars and
round arches. The rest is more modern, faid to have been built in
the reign of Edward III. who had in one part an apartment to lodge
in. The arches in this latter building are sharp pointed : the East
window remarkably fine.
The manufactures of Carlfle are chiefly of printed linnens, for
which near 3000 |, per annum is paid in duties. It is also noted
for a great manufacture of whips, which employs numbers of
children.
Salmons appear in the Eden in numbers fo early as the months
of December and January; and the London, and even Newcastle -
markets, are supplied with early fish from this river: but it is re-
markable, that they do not visit the Ef in any quantity till April, —
notwithstanding the mouths of both these waters are at a small dif-
tance from each other. I omitted in its proper place an account of
the Newcastle fishery, therefore insert here the little I could collect ;
relating to it. The fish. seldom appear in the Tyne till February :
there are about 24 fisheries on the river, besides a very considerable
were, and the whole annual capture amounts to about 36,000 fish.
I was informed that once the fish were brought from Berwick, and
cured at Newcastle; but at present, notwithstanding all goes. under ‘

rifon of what is caught in the Tweed.

The country near Carlisle consists of small enclosures ; but a little
farther on, towards Penrith, changes into coarfe downs. On the
East, at a distance, are ridges of high hills running paraltel to the
‘ road, with a good inclofed country in the intervening fpace. Above
Penrith is a rich inclosed traét, mixed with hedge-row trees and
woods, On the South-West, a profpeét of high and craggy moun-
tains. After I left Lockerly, Nature, as if exhausted with her la-
bors, in the lofty hills of Scotland, feemed to have lain down and
repofed herself for a considerable space ; but here began to rife again
, . with all the fublimity of alpine majesty.
PENRITH. PenritH is an ancient town, seated at the foot of a hill: isa
‘great thoroughfare for travellers ; but has little other trade, except
ANTIENT tanning and a small manufacture of checks. In the church-yard is
CoLvuns . monument of great antiquity, consisting of two stone pillars
eleven feet six inches high, and five in circumference in the lower
. ; part, which is rounded ; the upper is square, and tapers to a point:
in the square part is some fret-work, and the relievo of a cross ; and
; on the interior side of one is the faint representation of fome animal.
; Both these stones are mortised at their lower part into a round one:
. they are about fifteen feet asunder ; the space between them is in-
closed on each side with two very large but thin semicircular stones;
fo that there is left a walk between pillar and pillar of two feet in
breadth. Two of these leffer stones are plain, the other two have
_ certain figures at present scarce intelligible.

opportunity of re-examining these stones, and comparing them
with Doétor Todd's figures engraven in my XIIIth plate ; and

opinion of some gentlemen of the place whom I consulted on the
occasion.
Not far from these pillars is another called the Giant's thumb, five
feet eight inches high, with an expanded head perforated on both
sides; from the middle the stone rises again into a lesser head
rounded at top, but no part has a tendency to the figure of a cross,
being in no part mutilated ; fo that it is difficult to judge of the ufe .

On consulting a very old register kept in this parish it appears
that the plague raged here for fifteen months; from the 224 Sep
1597 to 5th Fan. 1598. and that only 680 persons were buried in
the parish during that time, It seems therefore probable that
Penrith must have been the centre of some particular distri, and
: that the numbers recorded on the wall muft comprehend all that
died within that space. Penrith now contains about 2000 fouls.
At a medium, 63 have died annually the laft ten years, or 630 in the
whole. In the ten years preceding the peftilence there were only
686 funerals; fo that there was no great difference between the
number of inhabitants at that and the prefent time. Some centuries
previous to this Penrith had another vifitation of the fame nature.
When the Scots under the Earl of Douglas in 1380 made an inroad
l into Cumberland, they surprized this place at the time of the fair *,
and returned with immense booty ; but suffered severely in conse- _

quence, for they introduced into their country the plague con-
tracted in this town, which swept away one third of the inhabitants
of Scotland +. l

It appears not to have been of a high antiquity; for in a compro-
mise of certain differences between Henry III. and Alexander King
of Scotland, it was stipulated that Henry should grant to Alexander
200 librates of land in Northumberland or Cumberland, if fo much
of Henry’s land could be found in any of the places where no castle
was situated ; and Penrith was part of this grant. Richard Duke

the valley of Mary Magdalene, and was granted to them by Robert de

great quantities of wool from Scotland and Durham.

### 1. OF SCOTCH PINES;

By James Farquuarson, Esq; of InvercauLD.
T is generally believed that there are two kinds of fir trees,
the produce of Scotland, viz. the red or refinous large trees,
of a fine.grain, and hard solid wood: the other, a white wood-
ed fir with a much smaller proportion of resin in it, of a coarser
grain, and a soft spongy nature, never comes to such a size, and
much more liable to decay. Ar first appearance, this would readi- .
ly denote two diftinct species, but I am convinced that all the trees
in Scotland, under the denomination of Scotch fir, are the same; and
that the difference of the quality of the wood, and size of the trees,

is certainly owing to circumstances, such as the climate, sitvation,

and foil they grow in. These finest fir trees, appear in the most

mountainows parts of the Highlands of Scotland, in glens or on fides

of hills generally lying to a Northerly aspect, and the foil of a hard:
gravelly consistence, being the natural produce of these places; the:

winged seeds are scattered in quantities by the winds, from the cones.

of the adjacent trees, which expand in April and May, with the
heat of the fun; these seedlings when young, rife extremely clofe-

together, this makes them grow ftraight, and free from side branches
. of any fize, to the height of 50 or 60 feet before they acquire
the diameter of a foot: even in this progress to. height, they are

very flow, occaftoned by the poornefs of the foil, and the numbers.

a planted fir of fifty years of age mentioned, and I counted exactly
two hundred and fourteen circles or coats, which makes this natural
fir above four times the age of the planted one. Nowas to planted |
firs, these are raised first in dreffed ground from the seed, where they l
stand two seasons or more, then are planted out in the ground they
are to continue in at regular distances, have a clear circumference
pound them for extending both roots and branches; the one gives
too quick. nourishment to the tree which shoots out in luxuriant
growths, and the other allows many of the branches to spread hori-
zontally, spoiling the timber with. knots; besides, this quick growth
occasions these thick yearly circular coats of wood, which form a |
coarse grain, of a spongy soft nature. The juices never after ripen
into a proportional quantity their refinous preservative balm: so-
that the plantations decay before the wood acquires. age, at a valu--
able size, and the timber when used in work has neither strength,
beauty, nor duration. I believe the climate has: likewise a great
share in forming the nature of the best wood, which.I account for:
in the following manner. The most mountainous parts of the
Highlands, particularly the Northerly hanging situations, where
- these fine fir trees are,. have a much shorter time of vegetation than.
a more Southerly exposure, or the lower open countries, being.
shaded by high hills from the rays of the sun even at_ mid-day for
mionths together, so that with regard to other vegetables nature
visibly continues longer in a torpid state there than in other places. —_—_

. a gratefulnefs for better soil and more sun by shooting out fponta-
neously, but if the plant or tree is so altered by this luxury that it
cannot attain any degree of perfection fit for the purposes intended,
the attempt certainly proves in vain.

From what is said above, it is not at all my intention to dissuade
from planting Scorch fir, but to encourage those that have the pro-
per foil and situation to do fo, being of opinion that where these

circumstances agree, and there, planting not in lines, but irregularly
and thicker than common, the trees will come to be of equal size
and value with the natural ones. In confidence of this, I have
planted several millions on the sides of hills out of reach of seed

### 2. OF ELGIN AND THE SHIRE OF MURRAY

By the Rev. Mr. Saaw, Minister of Excin.
TT. parish of Exarn can afford little matter for answering Mr:
Pennant's queries, and therefore I extend my view thro’ the |
whole province or country of Murray, extending by the coast from
the river of Spey to the East, to the river of Beauly to the West,
which is the boundary of the province of Ross: and extending to the
South-West as far as the North end of Loch-Lochy, and comprehend-
ing the countries of Strath/pey, Badenoch, Strathern, Strath-nairn,
and Strath-nerick, all which were the feats of the ancient Moravienses.
I shall make my answers to the quzries in order, and advance no- _
thing but what consists with my personal knowledge, or for which
I have unquestionable authority.
I. This province is naturally divided by the rivers of Spey, Loffey,
Findern, Nairn, Ness, and Beauly. The river of Spey rising on the
borders of Lochaber is more than sixty Scotch miles, or a hundred
: Englifo

288 APPENDIX
Enghsb in length, but too rapid to be navigable. Upon this river
great floats of fir and birch wood are carried down to the firth; the
float is guided by a man fitting in a Courach, of which Solinus, Cap.
22. says of the Irish, © Navigant vimineis alveis, quas circumdant am-
bitione tergorum bubulorum,” a short but exact description of the Con-
rach. Itis in shape oval, about four feet long and three broad, a
{mall keel from head to ftern, a few ribs crofs the keel, and a ring of
pliable wood round the lip of it, the whole covered with the rough
hide of an ox or a horse. The rower fits on a transverse feat in
the middle, and holds in his hand a rope, the end of which is tied
to the float, and with the other hand he manages a paddle, and keeps
the float in deep water and brings it to shore when he pleases. The
rivers of Lossey, Findern and Nairn have nothing remarkable in them,
but the river of Ness is observable on the following accounts, viz. __
It runs from Loch-Ness, a lake 23 miles long, and from 2 to 3 broad;
this Loch is fed by a river running from Loch-Zech, into which a
river falls from Loch-Garrie, into which a river enters from Loch.
Queich: Loch-Nefs and the river running from it never freeze, bur
the water is warm in the keeneft frost. There are many other lakes
in this province, of which one called the lake Dundelchack is re-
markable: the inhabitants of the neighborhood told me that this
, lake is never covered with ice before the month of Fanwary, but in
that month and February one night's strong frost covers it all over
with ice: this lake stands in the parish of Durres, within two miles
of Loch-Nefs. On the East side of Loch-Nefs, a large mile above
the Loch, is the water fall of Fober, where the river Feach Len falls
over a steep rock about 80 feet in height; and the water breaking
upon the shelves, rarifies like -a fog. In this province are several
chalybeat

APPEND I Xx 289
Thalybeat mineral springs, as at Tinland in Lambride parish, at
Auchterblare in Duthel parish, at Relugos in Edenkeely parish, at
Muretown in Inverne/s parish, ,
II. In the parish of Draiuie there is a large cave open to the fea,
of a considerable length, breadth and height. There are many na- =
tural caves in the hills, within which hunters, herds and thieves
take shelter in time of storm : there is an artificial cave in the lands
of Raits in Badenoch, in which fugitives and thieves. were wont to
reft; but it is now demolifhed in part. Of the mountains in this
province I shall name but two or three: the Carngorm in Strathspey
is remarkable for its height, and for the ftones found upon it; I
have feen thefe ftones of blue, green, yellow, and amber colors; :
some fo. large as to make big snyf-boxes or small cups; some of a
hexagonal or pentagonal figure, and tapering to a point at each
end. These are now well known to the curious, and to jewellers,
Another mountain is Benalar in Badenoch, which I imagine is the
highest ground in Scotland, for waters running from it fall into the
fea at Dundee, at Inverlochy, and at Garmoch in Murray, On the
Weft side of Loch-Ne/s there is a hill called Adcafuarvoney: Mr.
Gordon the geographer was imposed upon by being told that it
is two miles perpendicular above the lake, and that on the top of it,
there is a small lake which could never be sounded, and communi-
cates with Loch-Nefs: but I can assure you it is not near one
mile above the Loch, and there is no such lake on the top of it,
For picturesque scenes, worth drawing, I know none except Loch-
Ness, with the rocks, woods, cascades of rills of water, and some
Plots of corn land, on both sides of the Lach, which make a de-
i Pp lightful

290 APPEND I x.
lightful scene to one sailing the Loch in the King's Yacht, or in a
barge.

III, No earthquake, that I can learn, was ever felt in this province.
No whirlwind any way remarkable : there are several echoes, but
scarcely worth the mentioning. About the year 1733 or 4, flashes of
lightning so struck the house of Ines near Elgin, as by entering in-
to crevises in the wall to drive out some big stones, likewise to rent
a considerable long vault, and to toss a large cap-ftone above forty

yards from the house, as the late Sir Harry Innes of that ilk told
me.

IV. The common difeafes in our country are fevers, rheums,
cold, scrofula, hysteric and hypocondriac ; bites of ferpents, and mad
dogs. Our natural phyficians cure fevers, by making the patient
drink plentifully of barley water or wangrefs, and when the fever
rifes high the patient drinks a large draught of cold water which
brings out a profuse sweat, that ends in a crisis. For rheums, they
twice a-day bath the part affected, pouring cold water upon it, and
after it is dried, rubbing it till it is warm, and covering it with plaid-
ing or flannel, For colds, they keep bed for two days, drinking
warm, and if they sweat not, they take the cold bath in a river or
brook, which produces sweat. The scrofula they find incurable,
but in young persons, by washing often with lime water, it cures in +
a few years, Hysterics and hypocondriacs, in my opinion, are the
effects of tea, coffee, stoth and laziness, but these diseases are never
known in our highlands. When one is bit by a ferpent or snake, if

he can reach the wound, he sucks the blood, covers the wound,

. ' and often foments the part wounded, and members round it, with

a decoction of the buds and leaves of ash trees. When one is bit

. by

by a mad dog, as often happens in the highlands, he with a razor
immediately cuts out the flesh of the part wounded, sucks the blood”
in plenty, and covers the wound with a handful of cobwebs: or if
he has not courage to cut out the flesh, and thereby to prevent the
poison from mixing with the blood, he causes the wound to be well suck-
ed, and then foments it with warm oil or melted butter. I have seen
these cures performed with remarkable success, We have had, fifty
years ago, a terrible disease called the Civans, which broke out into
blotches in several parts of the body, and often turned into a gan-
grene in the face: this difeafe was brought by the military returning
from Flanders, and was cured only by a plentiful falivation with
mercury, but now we are happily free from it.

V. In the parish of Elgin, William Calanch a farmer died about
the year 2740, at the age of about 119 years; we have had many
who lived to an 100 years; we have fome who have two thumbs on
each hand, or two great toes on each foot.

VI. and VII. In this town of Elgin the number of inhabitants
increafes, occafioned by ftrangers living in the borough and many
poor people coming from the country into it. But in the parish to
landward the number appears to decreafe, by reafon of tenants
taking up larger farms than formerly : the number now is above
5000.

VII. The corns raised in this province are wheat, barley, oats,
peas and beans, and rye. Of thefe in good years we have enough
to ferve the country, and to export above 20,000 bolls, befides
ferving the Highland countries. Our manufactures are linnen in
considerable quantities, wool and common stuffs, and now at Jever-

Pp2 nese

| _ wess a flourishing fail manufactory, and. a ropety. Our fishery is
considerable, for of white or sea fish there is great plenty to serve
the country and towns, and fometimes to export a little. And our
falmon on the rivers of Spey, Findern, Ness, and Beauly, serves the
towns and country, and we export annually to the value of about
12,000 1.

° IX. Near the frith, the farmers manure with fea ware or weeds,

which produces richly ; in other parts they use marle, lime, dung
‘of cattle, and in the Highlands sathing, 1. ce. keeping their cattle in ©

, fummer and autumn within pinfolds on barren or refted ground,
that by their dung they may enrich the soil; and in many parts
they ufe green earth mixed with the dung of black cattle and
horfes.

X. We cultivate some hemp, much flax, of which we not only
make linnen for home confumption, and have three bleaching fields
within the province, befides private bleaching, but we fell great

' quantities of linnen yarn to the merchants of Glasgow and others. We
likewise cultivate potatoes in great plenty to serve the country,

XI. From the Lowlands of the province few or no cattle are sent
out of the country, but from the highland glens and valleys, several
hundreds of black cattle, some. horses, but no fwine, are annually
fold into England and the Southern counties of Scotland.

XII. There are in this province several {mall mounts or motes of

which I cannot determine whether any of them be artificial or not?

_ they generally ftand about 40 paces one from another; I fhall

name only the following, viz. Near the town of E/gin are two little

mounts called the fhooting buts, and two of the fame kind are near

. the Kirk of Pesty. I am inclined to think, that before the inventi-

on of fire arms, these were marks for shooting at with bows and ar-

rows: but that in time of Druidism, they were the feats on which

the Druids met to determine questions in law and property; and

they are in the Galic language called Tomavoed, i. e. the Court hill;

and in the South they are called Laws, as North Berwick Law, - —

Largo Law, &c. I may add the Omnis terra or Mote hill at Scoon.

We have few military entrenchments worth the mentioning, as the

Romans encamped little, if at all, fo far North. Druidical circles

have been very frequent in this province, The stones were gene-

rally about four feet in length, and eighteen inches in breadth: for

the most part the stones are removed by the country people, and

I shall name but one or two, viz. At Stonny field near Inverne/s,.

there was a large circle about thirty feet diameter, some of the stones

as yet stand, In Durris at the North end of Loch-Ness is a Druid
‘temple of three concentric circles: in all of these druidical circles,

there was an altar stone at the centre, but that at Durris is taken

away, and near the centre is a hollowed stone, which either was a.

laver to wash in, or a bafon to receive the blood of the sacrifice.
Besides circles, there were many Druidical cairns in this country,

on which at their folemn festivals, they offered their sacrifices; these

cairns were about five feet high, and about thirty feet in circumfer- _
ence, and hedged around with ftenes pitted in the earth to prevent
the falling out of the stones of the cairn: such a cairn stands in the

parish of Alves, four miles from Elgin, another in the parish of '
Birney, two miles from that town ; and two or three near Avemore,.

in the parish of Duthel in Strath{pey. From these circles and cairns

many churches are to this day called CLacnan, i. e. a Collection.

of Stones ; -and-as they stood in time of Druidism in groves and

woods, a church in Wales was called Luan, probably from Lhure
a grove, There is within a half-mile to the East of the town of
Forres, an obelifk called Sevens’s stone. The height of it cannot
- now with certainty be known, it is said to be twelve feet funk in
the corn field. When some years ago it was likely to fall, the Coun-
tess of Murray caused it to be erected, and much sunk to prevent
falling: it is about 23 feet above ground, about 4 feet broad:
what is above ground is vifibly divided into feven parts, whereof
the lowest is almost hid by the stones supporting it; the second di-
. vision contains many figures, but much defaced; in the third com-
partment, are figures of men, and some- of beasts with human
heads ; the fourth contains enfigns and military weapons ; and in
the fifth, sixth and seventh, the figures are scarce discernible : on
the reverse, there is a cross, beneath which are two human figures
of a gothic form : this seems to be a monument of a battle fought
in that place, by K. Malcolm the II. of Scotland against the Danes,
about the year 1008. There are about two or three obelifks of 6
or 7 feet high below the Kirk of Alves, probably as monuments
. of skirmishes and the burying of men of some figure.
XIII. In this province we had two bishopricks, one abby, three
priories, one praceptory, and several convents. The first bishop-
rick was that of Murthlack, now Mortlich, ere&ted by K. Mak. II.
An. 1010, when he had given a total defeat to the Danes in that
valley : the diocese consisted only of three parishes, and after three
bishops had served there it was translated to Aberdeen, An. 1142,
+ As an account of it will be fully given by others, I insist not fur-
ther.
The second bishoprick was that of Murray. In the fourth cen-
tury

APPEND I x 295
tury the bishop affected a pre-eminence over his fellow prefbyters,
and an equality in many things to fovereign princes: as princes had
their thrones, were crowned, wore crowns, had their palaces, their
ministers of state, their privy council, and their subjects ; fo bishops
had a folium, a confecration, a mitre, palaces, dignified clergy,
chapter, and inferior clergy. The epifcopal bifhoprick of Murray,
was in my opinion erected by K. Alex. I.; and the bishops of it
were, in succession,
(1.) Gregorius, who is a witness in a charter of K. Dav. I. to.
Dumfermline, confirming K. Alexander's charter to that abby ; there
he is called Gregorius Moravienfis Episcopus : and in the foundation.
charter of the priory of Schoon, An. 1115, Gregorius Episcopus is a
witness, who probably was the same with the formerly mentioned.
(2.) William was made apostolic legate 4s: 1159, and died 1162.
I find not what time he was consecrated. .
(3.) Felix, is a witness in a charter by K. Wilkam, Wrlielmo filio
fresken, de terris, de Strablock, Rosoil, Inspkele, Duffus Machare, et
Kintray. He died about A. 1170.
(4) Simeon de Toney, Monk of Melrose, elected 1171, and died.
£1. 1184, he was buried in Birney.
(5.) Andrew, consecrated 4s. 1184, and died 1185.
- (6.) Richard, consecrated Idi. Martii, An. 1187, by Hugo bishop.
of St. Andrew's, and died 4x, 1203, and was buried in Spynie,
(7.) Bricius, brother of William lord of Douglas, and prior of
Lessmabego, elected An. 1203, and died nx. 1222, and was buried at
Spynie. He had represented to the pope that the former bishops
had no fixed fee, or cathedral, fome residing at Birney, some at
Kinnedar, and some at Spynie; and he obtained that Spynie should
. be

296 APPENDIX
be the bishop's fee: he appointed the dignified clergy and canons,
and founded a college of canons, eight in number. -
- (8.) Andrew (fon of William Marray of Duffus) Dean of Murray,
consecrated An. 1223. He founded the cathedral church at Elgin,
added 14 canons to the college, and assigned manses and prebends
for them, and for the dignified clergy, and died Ay. 1242.

Here it will be proper to give some account of the cathedral
church at Elgin, for it does not appear that Briceas built any church
at Spynie. Bishop Andrew was not pleased with the situation of

Spynie for a cathedral, and therefore petitioned the pope that because
of the distance from the burgh of Elgin, which would divert the
canons from their sacred functions to go and buy provisions in the
burgh, that he might allow the cathedral to be translated to the .

; Ecclefie sana Trinitatis prope Elgin: Pope Honorius granted his re-

quest, and by his bull dated 4%. 1du*. Aprilis 1224 empowered the

Bishop of Carhness, and the Dean of Rofemarky, to make the defired

tranflation. Thefe met at the place defired, on the 14 of the kalends

of August, As. 1224: and finding it “ in commodum Eccleiz,”

declared the church of the holy Trinity to be the cathedral church

of the diocefe of Murray in all times coming: it is faid that bifhop

Andrew laid the foundation stone of the church on the fame day

above-mentioned, but it does not appear what the form or dimen-

sions of that first church were.
' (9.) Simon Dean of Murray succeeded and died 1252, and was
buried in the choir of the cathedral near to bishop Andrew.

(10.) Archibald Dean of Murray, consecrated An. 1253, and died
December 5th, As. 1298, and was buried in the choir, This bishop .

. having no palace built one at Kinnedar, and lived there. In his

time William Earl of Ross having done great harm to the parfon of )
Petty, was obliged to do pennance, and for reparation gave the lands
of Catboll in Rofs to the bishops of Murray in perpetuum.
(11.) David Murray consecrated at Avignon in France, by Boneface
VIII. ayno 1299, and died January 20th, anno 1325.
(12.) John Pilmore, consecrated 3% Kal, Aprilis, anno 1326, and
died at Spysie on Michaelmas eve, 1362.
(13.) Alexander Bar, Doffor decretorum, consecrated by Urban V.
. en. 1362, died at Spymie, May 1397. In his time, viz. 4x. 1390, °
Alexander Stewart (fon of king Robert 11.) Lord Badenoch, commonly
called the Wolf of Badenoch, keeping violent poffeffion of the bifhop’s
lands, in that country, was excommunicated in refentment, in the
month of May, As. 1390. He with his followers burnt the town of
Forres, with the choir, of that church, and the Arch-Deacon's .
house; and in Faxe that year burnt the town of Elgin, the
church of St. Giles, the hospital of Maifon-Dieu, the cathedral
church, with eighteen houses of the canons in. the college of Elpin.
For this he was made to do pennance, and upon his humble submis-
sion, he was abfolved by Walter Trail bishop of St. Andrews, in |
the black-friars church of Perth (being first received at the door,
barefoot, and in sackcloth, and again before the high altar in pre-
| sence of the king and his nobles) on condition that he would make _
full reparation to the bishop and church of Murray, and obtain ab-
solution from the Pope. Bifhop Bar began the rebuilding of the
church, and every canon contributed to #4, as did every parish in
the diocese.
(14.) William Spynie, Chanter of Murray, D. 1. C. consecrated at
Avignon by Denedif the FX. Sept. 13th, 1397, and died Aug. 2oth,

troubles of the times caused it to make flow advances. On Fuly 3,
An. 1402, Alexander III. fon of the Lord of the Ifles, plundered

- Elgin, burnt many houses, and spoiled the houses of the canons :
he was excommunicated, and offered a sum of gold, as did every
one of his captains, and he received absolution : this money
was applied for erecting a cross and a bell in that part of the canonry
which lies next the bridge of Elgin. -

(15.) Fobn Innes, Parson of Duffus, Archdeacon of Cathness, and
L. L. D. was consecrated by Benedif the XIII. Fan. 23d. An. 1406,
and died April 25th, An. 1414, and was buried in his own isle in
the cathedral, where his statue at large still remains with this
inscription, ** Hic jacet reverendus in Christo Pater 6& Dominus
* D. Joannes Innes de Innes, bujus ecclefie Epifcopus, qui bec
© notabile opus incepit, et per Septennium edificavit.” He built that
isle and a part of the great steeple or tower. After his. death, the
chapter met and all. were sworn that on whomfoever the lot should
fall to be bishop, he should annually apply. one third of his.revenues.
until the building of the cathedral should be finished.

(16.) Henry Leighton, parfon of Duffus, and IL. L. D. was con-.
fecrated in Valentia by Benedi XIII. March 8th, As. 1415: he
diligently carried on the building, and finished the great tower,
and was translated to Aberdeen, An. 1425, The cathedral church.
having been completely finished in the time. of this bishop, I. shall
here describe that edifice, which. was all in the gothic form of archi-
tecture. It stood due East and Weft, in the form of a passion or:
Ferusalem cross : the length of it 264 feet: the breadth 35 feet:
the length of the traverse 114 feet.. The church was ornamented.

with five towers, whereof two parallel towers ftood on the Weft
end, one in the middle, and two at the East end: the two West .
towers stand entire in the stone work, and are each 84 feet high :
what the height of the spires was I do not find; probably they were
of wood, and fell down long since. The great tower in the centre
of the nave stood on two arched pillars croffing at top, and was, in-
cluding the fpires, 198 feet in height: the two turrets in the Eaft
end are still entire, and each has a winding stair-case leading to a
channel or paffage in the walls round the whole church. The height
of the side walls is 36 feet. The great entry was betwixt the two
towers in the Weft end: this gate is a concave arch, 24 feet broad
in base, and 24 in height, terminating in a sharp angle : on each fide
of the valves in the sweep of the arch are 8 round, and 8 fluted pi-
lasters, 62 feet high, adorned with a chapiter, from which arise 16
pilafters that meet in the key of the arch. Each valve of the door
was 5 feet broad, and -about 10 feet high. To yield light to this
large building, befides the great windows in the porticos, and a row )
of windows in the wall above, each 6 feet high, there was above the
gate a window of an acute angled arch 1g feet broad in bafe, and ;
27 in height : and in the Eaft end between the turrets, a row of
five parallel windows each 2 feet broad and 10 high: above thefe
five more each 7 feet high, and over thefe a circular window near
10 feet diameter: the grand gate, the windows, the pillars, the
projecting table, pedeftals, cordons, are adorned with foliage,
grapes, and other carvings. The traverfe, in length as above, feems
to have been built by the families of Dunbar and Innes, for the
North part of it is called the Dunbar’s ifle, and the South part the
Innes’ isle.

-afchite&ture communicating with the choir by a vaulted vestry. '
‘The howfe is an exact - oftagon, 34 feet high, and the diagonal
breadth within walls 37 feet: it & almost a cube arched and vatilted
at top, and the whote arched roof supported by one pillar in the
centre of the house. Arched pillars from every angle terminated
in the grand pillar, which is 9 feet in circumference, crusted over
with 16 pilafters, and 24 feet high : adorned with a chapiter from
which arife round pillars that spread along the roof, and join at top;
and round the chapiter are engraven the arms of feveral bishops.
There is a large window in each of seven fides, the eighth side com-
municating, a3 was said, with the choir; and in the North wall are five
Ralls cut in nitches for the bishop's ministers of state, viz. the dean,
shapter, archdeacon, chancellor, and treasurer, the Dean’s Stall raised
a step higher than the other four. This ftrncture of the cathedral
came to decay in the manner following, viz. The Regent Earl of
Murray being obliged to levy fome forces, and being ftraitned in
money, appointed by his privy council February 14, 1567, 8, the
sheriffs of Abérdeen and Murray, with other gentlemen, to take the
lead, thatch or covering off the cathedrals of Aberdeen and Murray,,
and to fell it for paying the troops, which ‘was done, and shipped.
for Holland ; but the fhip soon after launched in the fea, funk with.
the lead, which.it is thought was done by a superstitions Roman ca-
tholic, who was captain of it. Of this whole edifice, the chapter

An. 1711, the great tower or fteeple in the middle fell from the

The cathedral stood within the precinct of the college, near the
river side of Lossey.: this precin& was walled round with a strong :
stone wall, and was about 1000 yards in circumference, a part of |
the walls {till remains entire ;. it had four gates, every one of which.
probably had (as is apparent the Eastern had) an iron gate, a port- py
cullis, and a porter’s lodge: within the precin& the dignified clergy
and all the canons had houses and gardens, and without the precinct,
towards the town of Elgin, there was a small burrow with a cross,
where the church men purchased their prowifions. The bifhop’s
palace ftood at Spynie, a large mile from Elgin: when it stood entire,
it was the moft ftately I have feen in any diocefe in Scotland. The .
" area of the: buildings was an oblong fquare of 60 yards; in the
South-West corner stood a strong tower vaulted, the wall g feet thick,.
with an eafy winding stair-casc, a-cape house at top, with a battlement
round it. In the other three corners are small towers -with narrow’
rooms. In the South side of the area, there was a chapel and tennis
cour} : and in otherparts were stables and all neceflary offices. The
gate or entry was inthe middle of. the East wall, secured by an iron:
grate and a port-cullis : over the gate stand the arms of bishop Fohn- .
Ames, and the initial letters of his name, which affords a conjecture, .
that he was the first who built any part of this court. Around the
palace was a spacious -precin&, with gardens, and walks, and which
now pay twelve pounds fterling to the crown, The lands of Spynze
and the precinct were granted by the crown to one gentleman after
another till the revolution, and since that time, the precinét con-

The diocese of Murray comprised the counties of Murray and
Nairn, and the greatest part of the counties of Bamff and Inverness,
and had 56 pastoral charges. What the revenue of this bishoprick
was before the reformation cannot now be well known; for Patrick _
Hepburn, the last popish bishop, fewed and sold at least a third part
of the lands of the bishoprick, including what he was obliged to
' give to the Regent of Scotland, An. 1568, for harbouring his inter-
. .communed uncle Fames Earl of Bothwell, who married our unfor-
tunate Q. Mary, An. 1563, when an account of all dignified
-clergy’s revenues was called in. by the parliament, the revenues of
the bishoprick of Murray, as then given up, were as follows ; viz.
In money, £1649 : 7 : 7 Scots: wheat, 10 bolls: barley, 77
cchalders, 6 bolls, 3 firlots, and two pecks: oats, 2 chalders, 8
bolls: falmon, 8 lasts: poultry, 223. Besides the emoluments of
the regality of Spynie, and of the commissaries of Spynie and Inverness,
and the great teinds of the patifh of Elgin, and of St. Andrew's in
Murray, Ogfton, Laggon, and the bishop's share of the revenues of the
‘common kirks,
The only abby we had was that at Kinloss, which stood in what
is now called the parish of that name. It was founded by K. David I.
10™° Kal. Fanuarii, An. 1150. The abbot was mitred, and had a
seat in parliament: the monks were of the Cifercian order, called
Monachi Albi. K. David endowed it, as did K. William, with
many lands. Aselinus was the first abbot, and Robert Reid was the
Jaft. The revenues of the abby, 4s. 1561, were found to be, in
money,
.

money, 4. 1152 : 1:0, Scots: barley and meal, 47 chalders, 11
bolls, 1 firlot, and 3 pecks: oats, ro bolls 3 firlots: wedders,
34: geefe, 41: capons 60: and poultry, 125. The abbot had
a regality within the abby lands: Mr. Edward Bruce was made
commendator, and afterwards lord of Kinlofs, An. 1604: from
whom Alexander Brodie of Lethen purchased the lands of Kinlo/s;
and the fuperiority of the other abby lands. The ruins of the
building are fo small, that it cannot be known what it was when
entire; for, An. 1651 and 1652, the stones of it were fold, and car-
ried to build CromwePs fort at Inverness, and nothing now remains
but confufed ruins.
The oldest priory we had in this province was at Urqubart, three
miles East of Elgin. It was founded by K. David I. An. 1125, in
honor of the Trinity. It was a cell of Damfermline with Benediéfine
monks. K. David endowed it liberally. The revenues thereof
were not given up in Ar. 1563, and fo I can give no account of.
them. The priory lands were erected into a regality, but no vestige
of the buildings now remains. In 1565, Alexander Setor was made
commendator, and 1591, created Lord Urquhart, and An. 1605
Earl of Dumfermline; but the honors being forfeited in 1690, Seton
of Barns claimed the lordship, and about Ar. 1730 it was purchased.
by the family of Gordon.
The next priory was. at Plufcarden, founded by K. Alexander IT:
An. 1230, and named Vallis Sanéti Andree. It was planted by
Monachi Vallis Caulium: None but the prior and procurator were
allowed to go without the precinct ; the monks becoming vicious
were expelled, and other monks brought from Dumfermline. The
lands of. this priory were very considerable, and they had a Grangia
and.

304 . APPEND 1 Xx '

-and a cell of monks at Grazge bill, The revenue of this priory,
given up A. 1563, was in money £525: 10: 14, Scots: whear,
' 1 chalder, 1 boll, 2 firlots : malt, meal and barley, 51 chalders,
4 bolls, 3 firlots, 1 peck : oats, 5 chalders, 13 bolls : dry multures,
g chalders, 11 bolls: salmon 3o lasts. The buildings ftood 4
. miles S. W. from the town of Elgin, in a warm valley called the
—_ glen of Pluscarden, The walls of the precin&t make a large square,
| .and are pretty.entire. The church stands about the middle of the
square, a fine edifice in the form of a cross, with a square tower, all
of hewen ashlar. The oratory and refeSory join to the South end
.of the church, under which is the dormitory. The chapter house
is of curious work, an aftagonal cube, vaulted roofs supported by
.one pillar, all as yet entire. They had a regality.in the priory lands
and a diftin& regality in Grange bill, called the regality of Stancfore-
noon. At the reformation Sir Alexander Seton was, An. 1565, made
commendator. The lands of Pluscarden and Old Milus near Elgis
passed through several hands, and are now the property of James
Earl of Fife.
The third priory was at Kingufie, founded by Geoxge Earl of
Huntly, about An. 1490. Of what order the monks were, or what
were the revenues of the priory, I have not learned. The few lands
belonging to it being the donation of the family of Huntly, were at
the reformation re-afsumed by them, and continue to be their
property.
There were likewise within this province several canvents of reli-
gious orders. In the town of Elgin were Grey Friars, Black Friars,
Red Friars, Templars Houfes, and a Nunnery of the religious of Sy,

APPEND I Xx. 305
Katherine of Sienna, There were other convents at Forres and In-
. werness. ‘
Close by the town of Elgin stood the prasceptory of Maison Dieu.
It was a hospital for entertaining strangers, and maintaining poor
infirm people. The buildings are now gone to ruins. They had
confiderable lands in the parishes of Elgin, Lanbride, Knockando, and |
Dundurkus, all which were by K. James VI. and Charles I. granted to
the town of Elgin, and now hold few of them.
In this province we had four royal forts ;.the first stood on a round
hill that overlooks the town of Elgin; and some of the walls, all of
run lime, do as yet remain. The Earls of Murray since the year
1313 were constables of it, and had confiderable lands for their sa-
lary. Their office continued till 1748, when heritable offices were
. annexed to the crown, and now they have no more but the hill
ealled Lady hill, which yields a small rent annually. Another fort
stood in the town of Nairn, but no vestiges of it now remain.. '
Mr. Campbell of Calder (and formerly the Thanes of that ilk) was ;
constable, and in 1748 was paid a compensation for that office. The
; third fort was at Inverne/s, of which the Earls of Ross were formerly
constables ; and after their forfeiture, the Earl of Huntly obtained.
the office of. constable, with very considerable lands as a salary, and
© continued to be constable till 1629. I need not: here- speak of |
CromwelPs fort at Inverness, of which no doubt others will give a
full account. The fourth fort was at Urgubart, on the Welt side of |
Loch-Ness :@he buildings were pretty large, and in a great part as-
yer stand, In the time of David II. Alexander Boes was governor
of this fort; afterwards, Chifolm of that ilk was governor: but:
fince the middle of century fifteenth I do not find it had any go- '

vernor, and now the lands of Urquhart are the property of Sir Ludo-
wick Grant of Grant. Besides these forts we had many old castles
. within this province commonly called Fortalicia. One stood at
Duffus, three miles North of Elgin, and was the seat of the chief of
the Moravienses as early as the -eleventh century. The castle stood
on a green mote, on the bank of the Loch of Spynic : it was a square,
the wall about 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, with a parapet, a ditch,
and a draw bridge: within the square were buildings of timber for
accommodating the family, and also necessary offices. The walls
are as yet pretty entire. Such Fortalices were also at Balveny in the
parish of Murtlich, at Abernethy in that parish, at Lochindorb in the
Parish of Cromdil, at Raet in Nairn parish, and at Ruthven in Kingufie
parish. All which were large fquares, and many rooms built with
:timber within the walls.

I shall give no account of the modern forts of Fort George at
Arderfeir, or Fort Augustus at the South end of Loch-Nefs, and shall
only describe a promontory in the parish of Duffus, four miles from
Elgin. Our historians call it Burgus, it juts into the frith, and rises
above low water about fixteen yards. To the West and North it
is a perpendicular rock, to the East the ascent is steep but graffy,
to the South towards land the ascent is more easy. The area on
the top is near a reCtangular figure, in length about 100 yards,
and in breadth about 50. After the Danes had defeated the Scots
army at Forres about Ax. 1008, they sent for their wives and chil-
dren, and made this promontory an afylum to them and a place of

- arms. It was at top furrounded with a ftrong rampart of oaken
logs, of which fome are as yet digged up: by a trench cut on the
South side they brought the fea round the promontory, and within

. | this,

APPEND I X. 307
this, had other trenches, and they fortified it to the East. The
trenches are now filled up. After the battle of Mortéich in the year
1010, the Danes abandoned it, and left the country of Murray. -

both printed and manuscript, but all imperfe& ; comparing these
with the writings of Sir James Dalrymple, Sir Robert Sibbald, Bishop
| Keith, the chartulary of Murray, and the chronicle of Mel Ross, the
above catalogue may I think be depended upon. To return to the
queries. —
XIV. There are in this province manuscript histories of several
families, which might be of some service in compiling a general
History ; as of the families of Dunbar, Innes, Brodie, Calder, Kil-
.ravock, M* Intosh, and Grant. With regard to ancient weapons,
I have seen in the house of Gaunt, of Kilreveck, and in other
houfes, fteel helmets, habergeons, and coats of mail, and of buff
leather. Adder stones, glass beds, &c. are but amulets not worth
regarding,
XV. I know not one picture worth regarding, except a picture
of the Virgin Mary in the house of Cafle Grant.
XVI. No battle in the parish of Elgin, but many within this
province, as at Forres, about 4”, 1008, betwixt the Scots and Danes ;
at Morthch, As. 1010, between the fame; at Spey-mouth, As. 1078,
the King against the Moravienses; again, A. 1110, against the fame
people ; and, 4. 1160, on the Muir of Urquhart, king Malcolm IV.
- against the same Moravienses; at Ceanlochlochie, An. 1544, betwixt
the Frazers and M* Donalds , at Glenlivet, An. 1594, the King against
the Earls of Huntly, Errol, and Angus; at Auldearn, An. 1645, the
Covenanters against Montrose; at Cromdel, An. 1690, the King’s troops
against the Highlanders; and at Culloden, An. 1745, the Duke of
| Cumberland against the Rebels.
' XVII. Druidism having been the form of religion in this coun-
sry before Christianity, the people still retain some superstitious cuf-
roms

toms of that Pagan religion. As Behtein: on the first of May the
herds of feveral farms gather dry wood, put fire to it, and dance
three times Southways about the pile. In the middle of June
farmers go round their grounds with burning torches, in memory
of the Cereaka. On Hallow even they have feveral superstitious
customs. At the full moon in March, they cut withes of the mifle-
toe or ivy, make circles of them, keep them all year, and pretend
to cure hecticks and other troubles by them. And at marriages
and baptisms they make a proceffion around the church, Deasoil, i. e.
sunways, because the sun was the immediate object of the Druids’
worship.
XVIII. Their sports are hunting, firing at marks, foot-ball, club-
ball, &c. And the only annual festival they observe is Chriftmas ,
spent more as the Saturnalia were of old, than as Chrif’s birth ought
to be.
XIX. We have no true marle in this country, nor any afbeftus :
but we have granite, talcum, lapis specularis, and at Stadtfeld within
four miles of Elgin there was lately found lead ore, and in Glen-garry
they have for several years had an iron forge and made pigs of iron;
likewise about 40 years ago, a company from England fet up a miH
and forge for iron in Abernethy in Strathspey, and made very good _
bars of iron, but through their own extravagance they abandoned it,
There is through all this province great plenty of iron ore. T have
often seen the ignis fatuus, which is a piece of rotten birch wood,
lying in a mire, and shining in a dark night, like a flame of firs :
likewise ignis lambens, which is an unctuous vapour falling upon a
man's wig, or mane of a horse, which shines bright, but by a flight
rub it is extinguished,
XX, Great

310 APPEND I Xx.

_ XX. Great plenty of the particulars in the 2oth query may be
found on the sea coast in this province ; if any will take the trouble
to-collect them.

" XXI. I know no species of wood remarkable, and peculiar to
this province, except Red Saugh, or fallow, which is no less beau-
tiful than mahogany, and is much more firm and tough, and not fo
brittle ; it receives a fine polish, and in color resembles light-colored
mahogany ; it grows in. rocks, and is very rare. But we have great
forests of firs and birches: and as the Grampian hills divide in

Athol into one branch running Northward, and another Eastward ;
in the former branch are great woods of fir and birch in Breadalbane,
Rannoch, Strathspey, Badenoch, Glen-morifton, Strathglafs, and Strath-
carron in Sutherland; and in the other branch are such forests in
Brae-mar, Glen-muik, Glen-tanner, &c. I am inclined to think that
these are the remains of the ancient Sy/va Caledomia. Among other

vegetables, we have in great plenty, in the heaths and woods, the
following berries, viz. wild rafps, wild strawberries, blueberries, bug-
berries, wva urfe, &c. And we have one root I cannot but take
notice of, which we call Carmele : it is a root that grows in heaths
and birch woods to the bignefs of a large nut, and fometimes four
or five roots joined by fibres; it bears a green ftalk, and a {mall
red flower. Dio, speaking of the Caledonians, says, *© Certum citi
“© genus parant ad omnia, quem fi ceperint quantum eft unius fabe
* magnitudo, minime esurire aut sitire solent.” Cesar de Bel. Civ.
lib. 3% writes, that Yalerius's soldiers found a root called Canara,
“* quod admistum latte multam inopiam levabat, id ad fimilitudinem
panis efficiebant.” I am inclined to think that our Carmele (i. e.
{weet root) is Dio's Cibi genus, and Cezsar's Chara: I have often
seen


APPENDIX, 311
feen it dried, and kept for journeys through hills where no provisions
could be had: 1 have likewise seen it pounded and infused, and
when yest or barm is put to it, it ferments, and makes a liquor more
agreeable and wholesome than mead. It grows fo plentifully, that a
cart load of it can eafily be gathered, and the drink of it is very
balfamic.
XXII. Sea fowl in this province refort in winter to lakes and
lochs, as Loch of Spynie, Loch-Ness, Loch Nadorb, &c. Eagles
and Falcons breed in high rocks and inacceffible mountains, as
Scorgave in Rothemurchus. There are some species of fowls, if not.
peculiar to this province, at least rare in other countries: such as,
the Caperkyly, as large as the domestick Turkey ; it frequents the fir
woods, and perches in the top of very tall trees, but the hen breeds
in the heath. Another fowl is the Black Cock, which frequents birch
woods in hills, is of the fize of a capon, of a shining blue color: it
is by some authors called Gallus Scoticanus. A third fowl is Tarma- '
gan, of the size of a Partridge, haunts the high rocky hills, is of a .
color spotted brown and white. These three fowls are very harm-
less, and make delicious food.
N. B. In answering query IV. it is omitted that our natural
physicians, when they find a toe or a finger hurt, and beginning to
corrupt, they strike it off with a chisse] and fere the wound with a
hot iron, and soon cure it, Instead of bleeding by lancets, they
scarify the flesh about the ancle, and they take blood from the nasal
vein by cleaving the quill of a hen and binding it into four branches, -
and scarifying the nostrils thereby. For vomits, they use a decoétion
of groundfill, of the bark of the service tree, and a decoftion of
Holborn faugh; and for purgatives, the decoction of service
bark

31% APPENDIX |
bark and a decoction of mugwort boiled jn new whey. In anfwer-
ing quzry I. I omitted to fay, that the river of Bewly was antiently
called Farar : it rises in the hills towards Glenelg, and runs through
Glenftratbfarar ; and I am inclined to think that in Ptolemy’s Geo.

| graphical Tables the Murray frith is called Afuarium Vararis from
the river Farar (changing the F into V) that falls into the head of
it. And the river was called Bewly when, A. 1230, a priory of the
monks Vallis Caulium was settled there, who called their seat Beaukeu,.
i,e. Bellolsto; and then the old name of Farar was discontinued, ex-
cept among the Highlanders..

THIS compilation was some years ago printed at Aberdeen, I have had opportu- ;
nity of comparing it with moft of the authorities quoted in fupport of the hif- =
tory of fo extraordinary a person, and find them used with judgment and fide-
lity. Excepting a few notes, I present it to the readers in the state I found it: |
and shall only acquaint them that the life of this Glory of North Britain may be
found in the 81st Number of the Adventurer, treated in a more elegant, but far. _
less comprehensive manner.

P i \HIS gentleman was descended from a very ancient family; -
his father Robert Crichton of Clunie and Eliock, was one of
those who commanded Queen Mary's army at the battle of Langfide —
in the year 1568. He was born at C/unie*, his paternal inheritance;
* The prefent-houfe of C/unie stands in an island in a lake of the fame name, _
But the old house or castle stood on one side of the water: and its place is distin=
guifhed by nothing but a mound and imperfect moat,
Sf in

in the shire of Perth, in the year 1551. He was taught his grammar
at the school of Perth, and his philosophy at the university of St.
. Andrews * under Mr. Jobn Rutherford + He had hardly attained
to the 20th year of his age, when he had run through the whole
circle of the sciences, and could speak and write to perfection in ten
different languages ; but this was not all; for he had likewise im-
proved himself to the utmost degree in riding, dancing, singing, and
playing upon all sorts of inftruments.
Having thus accomplifked himfelf at home, his pareats Rht him
abroad to accomplish him further by travelling. And coming to
Paris, it is not to be imagined what consternation he raised in that
‘ famous university ; as we have it from an eye-witnefs, who gives us
this account of it + : “ There cate,” says he, © to the college of
® Navarre, a young man of 20 years of age, who. was perfectly
<< well feen in all the sciences, as the most learned. masters of the
“ univerfity acknowledged: in vocal and inftrumental: mufic none
“* could excel him, in painting and drawing in colors none could
* equal him; in all military feats he was most expert, and could
“ play with the sword fo dexterously with both his hands, that no
“* man could fight him; when he saw his enemy or antagonist, he
“ would throw himself upon him at one jump of 20 or 24 feet

< distance: He was a master of arts, and disputed with us in the
* schools of the college upon medicine, the ciyil and canon law,
< and theology, and although we were above fifty in number, be-
* fides above three thousand that were present ; and fo pointedly _
« and learnedly he answered ta all the questions that were proposed
* to him, that-none but they that were present can believe it. He
** spake Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and other languages most politely :
* he was likewise an excellent horseman, and truely if a man should
* live an hundred years without eating, drinking or sleeping, he
* could not attain to this man’s knowledge, which struck us with a
* panick fear; for he knew more than human nature could well
“© bear; he overcame four of the doétors of the church; for in
* learning none could contest with him, and he was thought to be ©
* Antichrist.”
Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty giving an account of this dif- -

pute, says, that Crichton, when he came to Paris, caused fix pro-
grams on all the gates of the schools, halls and colleges belonging
to the university, and on all the pillars and posts before the houses
of the most renowned men for literature in the city, inviting all
those who were well versed in any art or science, to dispute with
him in the college of Navarre, that day six weeks, by nine of the
clock in the morning, where he should attend them, and be ready ' -
to answer to whatever should be proponed to him in any art or fci-
ence, and in any of these twelve languages, Hebrew, Syriack, Ara-
dick, Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, English, Dutch, Flemifb
or Sclavonian, and that either in verse or prose, at the discretion of
the disputant; and during all this time instead of making a closs
application to his studies, he minded nothing, but hunting, hawk-

ing, tilting, vaulting, riding of a well managed horse, toffing the
pike, handling the musket, and other military feats, or in house
games, such as balls, concerts of music vocal and instrumental,

the eminent men in Jtaly in that age were acquainted with him, as
we shall show in the remaining part of the history of his life. A-
bout two years after his dispute at Paris, Trajano Boccalini in his
advertisements from Parnassus, tells us, that he came to Rome;
Boccalini being then at Rome, himself, and by a placad which he
affixed upon all the eminent places of the city, he challenged all
the learned men in Rome, in the following terms, Nos Facobus
Crichtonus Scotus, cuicunque rei propofite ex improviso respondebinius, ' ;
That is to say, he was ready to answer to any question that could

universal knowledge, that they were no less surprized with him, than

they had been at Paris.
. From Rome he goes to-Venice, where he contrasted an intimate
friendship with Aldus Manutius, Laurennius Massa, Speron Speronius,
.and feveral other learned men, to whom he presented several poems
in commendation of the city and university, and among the rest,
.one to Aldus Manutius, which we have still extant in the Deftie
Poetarum Scotorum*, This poem gave him a very agreeable sur-
prize, being presented by a stranger, whom he judged by the per-
formance to be a person of an extraordinary genius ; but when he
came to discourse with him, he was struck with admiration, and
finding him known in every thing, he brought him to the acquaint-
ance of all the people of learning of note that were in Venice, and
all of them were fo furprized with him, that they thought him, as
he really was, the wonder of the world, and never spoke of him
but with admiration; at length being brought before the doge and
senate, he made a handsome speech to them, which being accom-
panied with all the graces and beauties of eloquence and nature +

thanks of the fenate, and nothing was talked through the whole
city, but of this prodigy of nature. Having ftayed for fome time

there was a meeting of all the learned men in the city, in the house
of Facobus Moyfius Cornelius, to wait upon him, and converse with
him: He opened the assembly with an extemporary poem in praise
of the city, university, and the assembly that had honored him with
their presence at that time; and after fix hours of a dispute, which
he sustained against them, in whatever they could propose to him
in all the sciences, he concluded with an extemporary oration in
praise of ignorance, that Aldus Maxztexs * says that they all thought
' that they were in a dream, and that he had almost persuaded
them that it was. better to be ignorant, than learned and wise.
Some time after this he fixed a paper on the gates of St. Fobz |
and St. Paul’s churches, wherein he offered to prove before the
university, that there was an infinite number of errors in Aris-
totle’s philosaphy, which was then. only in vogue, and in all his
commentaries, both in theological and philosophical matters, and
to refute the dreams of several mathematicians : He likewise made
an offer to dispute in all the sciences, and to anfwer to whatever
should be proposed to him, or objected againft him, either in the
common logical way, or by numbers and mathematical figures, or
in a hundred sorts of verses as they pleased. _—
Aldus Manutius, who was present at this dispute, fays +, that ‘he-
performed all that he had promifed,.to their greatest amazement : _=

tells us *, that he was informed by his father, who was prefent at
this dispute, that it was with one Archangellus Mercenarius, a fa-
mous philosopher, upon philosophical fubjects, in which he acquit-
ted himself fo well, that his adversary owned before the assembly
that he had overcome him,
From Venice he went to Mantua; at this time there was a gladi-
ator at Mantua, who had foiled in his travels the most famous
fencers in Europe, and had Jately killed in that city three persons
who had entered the lifts with him; the Duke of Mantua was high-
' ly offended that he had granted this fellow his protection, since it
. had fuch a fatal confequence: Crichton being informed of this, of-
fered his fervice to the Duke, to rid not only his dominions, but
Italy of this murtherer, and to fight him for fifteen hundred pif-
toles: though the Duke was unwilling to expofe fuch a fine gen-
tleman as our author, to fuch an hazard, yet relying upon the re-
port of his performances in all warlike atchievements, it was agreed
to; and the time and place being appointed, the whole court were
witnefs to the performance. In the beginning of the combat,
Crichton was upon the defensive, and the Italian attacked him with
such vigor and eagerness, that he began to grow faint, having over-
acted himself; then our author attacked him with such dexterity
and vigor, that he run him through the body in three different
Places, of which he immediately died. The huzza's and acclama-

all of them acknowledged, that they had never seen art grace nature,

they had seen that day; and to crown the glory of this ation,
Crichton bestowed the prize of his victory upon the widows .
who had lost their husbands in fighting with this gladiator.

These, and his other wonderful performances, moved the Duke
‘of Mantua to make choice of him for preceptor. to his son Vincent
de Gonzagua, a prince of a riotous temper, and diffolute life. The
court was highly pleased with the Duke's choice, and for their di-
version he composed a comedy, wherein he exposed and ridiculed *
all the weaknesses and failures of the several employments that men
-betake themselves to; which was looked upon as one of the most
ingenious fatires that ever was made upon mankind; but that
which was most wonderful and astonishing was, that he himself

One night as he was walking alongst the streets in the time of

half a dozen people in masks; but they found that they had not
an ordinary person to deal with, for they were not able to stand:
their ground against him, and having difarmed the principal person
amongst them, he pulled off his. mask, and begged his life, telling.
him, that he was the prince his pupil. Crichton, who immediately
knew him, fell down upon his knees, and told him that he was

he presented him with it ; which the prince taking in his hand, and
not being able to overcome his passion for the affront that he
thought he had sustained, in being foiled with all his attendants, he
immediately run him through the heart.

What moved the prince to this ungenerous and brutal action, is
variously conjectured ; for some think that it was jealousy, fufpect-
ing that he was more in favors with a young lady whom he passion-
ately loved than he was. Others fay, that it was only to try his >
valor, and the effect of a drunken ramble; but whatever was the
cause of it, *tis certain that thus he died, in the beginning of the
month of July, in the year 1583, in the thirty-fecond year of his
age, or, as Imperialis says, in the twenty-second.

His death was extraordinarily lamented by all the learned men
in Europe, and from these Jtekanx writers, who knew, and were co-
temporary with him, it is, that I have most of all that I have said
of him. Foames Imperialis, a doctor of medicine of Vicenza in Italy,
who has wrote our author's life, and who could not but know the
truth of all, or most of what he has said of him, since he lived upon
the places in which they were acted, and who had them from his
father, who was an eye and ear witness to them, says *, © That he
* was the wonder of the last age, the prodigious production of na-
< ture, the glory and ornament of Parnassus in a ftupendious and

gious memory þ that he retained more books upon his mind, than
any of his age had read; Plures libros memoriter tenebat quam quis-

And Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty, having insisted on all the
particulars of our author's life in a fustian and bombastical strain,
tells us, that in the comedy which he composed, and was an actor
in before the court of Mantua, in the fifth and last a&, he himself
personated no less than 13 different characters of persons and em-
ployments in their different habits, -

And in his character of him, he tells us, that he gained the esteem

the rich, by his affability and good fellowship; of all the poor, by -
his munificence and liberality ; of all the old, by his constancy

the learned, by his universal knowlege ; of all the soldiers, by his =~
undaunted valor courage; of all the merchants and artificers,
by his upright and dealing and honesty ; and of all the fair sex, by his
beauty and handsomeness ; in which respect, he was a master-piece
of Nature. “‘ The reader,” says he, © perhaps will think this wonder- *
ful, and fo would I too, were it not that I know, as © Philip ‘
Sidney says, that a wonder is no wonder in a wonderful fubject,
and consequently not in him, who for his learning, judgment, va-
lor, eloquence, beauty and good fellowship, was the perfecteft re-
sult of the joint labors of Pallas, Apollo, Mars, Mercury, Venus
' and Bacchus, that hath been since the days of Alcibiades, and he
was reported to have been enriched with a memory so prodigious,
that any fermén, speech, harangue, or other manner of discourses
of an hour's continuance he was able to recite without hesitation,
after the same manner of gesture and pronunciation in all points,
wherewith it was delivered at first ; and of so stupendious a judge- ” |
ment, that nothing escaped his knowlege :”” And for the truth of '
all this, he appeals to above two thousand witnesses, that were still
alive, and had known him. And speaking of his death, which he
atfributes to an amour, he fells us, that it was in the 32d year of his
age; that the whole court went in mourning for him; that the epi-
taphs and elegies that were composed upon his death, if collected,
would exceed the bulk of Homer's works, and that his picture was
{till

{till to be seen in the most of the bed-chambers and palleries of the
Ttalian nobility, representing him upon horseback, with a lance in
the one hand, and a book in the other *.

Dempster, who was cotemporary with him, and a professor of the
civil law at Bononia in Italy, agrees as to the most of what we have
said of him; but he tells us +, that he was for some time at Geneva,
as he was on his travels to italy, and that they offered him a confi-

, derable salary, if he would remain with them; but that he refused
it, and that no man offered to detract. from his just praises, but
Trajano Boccalini, but that he being a person of no erudition, it
was rather a glory than any disgrace upon him to be fo treated by

—_— a person of his charaéter. Yet the fame Dempfter blames our au-
thor very much, not for his boasting of the endowments of his
mind, but for his affirming that he was descended from the royal
family of Scotland, Many poems and epitaphs were composed up-
on him, but I shall only insert that of our countryman, Dr. Jobm
Johnston, in his inscriptions upon our heroes, who makes him die
in the year 1581,

### 4. OF THE MURDER OF A LAIRD OF INNES, AS RELATD IN THE OLD ACCOUNT.

L | OHN Lord Innes, having no children, settles his estate upon his
next heir and cousin Alexander Innes of Cromy, and seems to

suffer him to enjoy his title and possessions in his life time. Robert

Innes of Innermarky, another cadet of the family, is disgusted to see .
* Innes of Cromy endowed with so much power and preferred to him.

He alarms Lord John, and makes him repent fo far of what he had

done, that he joins in conspiracy with Innermarky to assassinate his -

cousin Alexander. The author says, © John being brought over to

his minde (viz. Innes’s of Innermarky) there wanted nothing but

a conveniency for putting y* purpose to execution, which did offer
itself in y. month of Apryle 1580, at wa, tyme Alex, being called

upon some bufines to Aberdeen was obliged to stay longer there then

he intended, by reafone that his only fone Robert a youth of 16 yeirs

of age hade fallen sick at the college, and his father could not leave

the place untill he saw qt became of him. He hade transported him

\ Uu . out

3390 _ APPEND I XxX

out of the old toune, and hade brought him to his own lodgeing in
the new toune ; he hade also sent several of his servants home from
tyme to tyme to let his Lady know the reafone of his stay, by means
of these servants it came to be known perfectly at Kinnardy in qf cir-
cumftance Alexander was at Aberdeen, q he was lodged, and how
he was attended, which invited Jnmermarky to take the occafione.
Wherefore getting a confiderable number of affiftants with him, he

hade, Laird John ryde to Aberdeen: they enter the toun upon the
night, and about middnight came to Alexander's lodgeing.

. The outer gate of the clofs they found oppen, but all the reft
of the doors fhutt; they wer afraid to break up doors by violence,
leaft the noife might alarm the neighbourheed, but choifed rather to
ryse such a cry in the clofs as might obleidge those who wer within
to oppen the door and fee qt it might be. . The feuds at that tyme

betwixt the familys of Gordone and Forbes wer not extinguished,
therfor they ryfed a cry, as if it hade been upon some out fall among
thefe people, crying belp a Gordon, a Gordon, which is the gathering
word of the friends of y* familie. ° ,
Alexander, being deeply interefted in the Gordon, at the noife of
the cry ftarted from his bedd, took his fword in his hand and op-
pened a back door that led to y* court below, stept down three or
four steps and cryed to know qt was the matter. Innermarky who
by his word knew him, and by his whyt shirt decerned him perfect-
ly, cocks his gun and shootts him through the body in ane instant.
As many as could get about him. fell upon him and butchered him
barbarously. Jwnermarky perceaveing in the mean tyme y* Laird
Fobn stood by, as either relenting or terified, held the bloody dag-
ger to his. throatt that he hade newly taken out of the murthured
« body,

APPEND I Xx, 33r
body, swearing dreadfully yt he would serve him the same way if he
did not as he did, and fo compelled him to draw his dagger and
stab it up to the hilts, in the body of his nearest relatione, and the
braveft that boare his name, After his example all who wer ther
behooved to do the lyke, that all might be alyke guilty; yea in
profecutione of this, it has been told me that Mr. Fohn Innes, after-
wards Coxtoune, being a youth than at school], was rysed out of his
bedd and compelled by Jumermarky to ftab a daggar unto the dead |
body, that the more might be under the same condemnatione ; a
very crafty cruelty.
The next thing looked after was the deftructione of the fick youth
Robert, who hade lyein-y* night in a bedd by his father, but upon
the noyfe of qt was done, hade scrambled from it, and by the help
of one Fohn of Culdreafons, or rather of some of the people of the
houss, hade got out at ane unfrequented bak door into the garden,
and from ye into a neighbour's houss, q” he hade fhaltered; the
Lox in his providence preferveing him for the executing vengence
upon these murthurers for the blood of his father. ;
Then Junermarky took the dead man’s fignet ring, and fent it to
his wife, as from her hufband, by a fervant whom he hade purchafed
to that purpofe, ordering her to fend him fuch a particular box
q® contained the bond of Tailie, and all yt hade followed thereupon
| betwixt him and Laird Joby, whom the servant faid he hade left
we his m* at Aberdeen : and y* for dispatch he hade fent his best hors
with him, and hade not taken leafure to writ, but sent the ring.
\ Though it troubled the woman much to receave such a blind mea-
sage, yet her husband's ring, his own servant and his horss, prevailed .
Uu2 so

332 APPEND ISNX
so with her, togither with the man's importunity to be gone, that
thee delivered to him qf he fought, and let him go.

There happened to be then about the houss a youth related to the
family, who was courious to go to the lenth of Aberdeen, and see ,
the young Laird who hade been fick, and to whom he was much
adiéted. This youth hade gone to the stable to interceed with the
fervant that he might carrie him behind him, and in his difcourfs
hade found the man under great reftraint and confufion of minde,
fometyme fayeing he was to go no further than Kinnardy (which in-
deed was the truth) and at oy tymes that he behooved to be imme-
diately at Aberdeen.

This brought him to be jealous, though he knew not qf, but
further knowledge he behoved to have, and therfor he stept out a
little beyond the entry, watching the servant's comeing, and in the
by going sudently leapt on behind him, and would needs either go

alonges with him, or have a fatisfieing reasone, why he refuffed
him. ,

The contest became fuch betwixt them, that the servant drew
his ' durk to ridd him of the youth’s trouble, q® the other wrung
out of his hands, and down right killed him wt it, and brought
back the box wi® the writs and horss to the houfs of Innes (or Cromie,
I know not q®.)

As the lady is in a confufione for qt hade fallen out, ther comes
aneother of the servants from Aberdeen, who gave ane account of

the slaughter, so that shee behooved to conclude a speciall hand of
Providence to have been in the first pasage. Her next courss was
to secure her husband's writts the best she could, and flee to her
friends for shalter, by whos means she was brought wt all speed to
the

APPEND I Xx. 333
the king, befor whom shee made her complaint. And qr is heir
set doun is holden by all men to be true matter of fact.
The Earle of Huntly imediatly upon the report of the slaughter
concerned himself becauss of his relatione to the dead, and looked
out for his son, whom he instantly carried to Edinburgh, and put
him for shalter into the family of the Lord Elphinfloune, at that tyme
Lord high Treasurer of the kingdome. .
Innermarky and Laird Fobn, after the slaughter, came back to the
Lord Saltoun’s houss, who leived then at Rothimay, and is thought
to have been in the knowledge of q, they hade been about, for
certaine it is they wer supported by the Abernethys, ay untill the

derable party of horfs, and repofceft Laird John in all the parts of
the estate of Innes. And Innermarky, to make the full use' of gt he
hade fo boldly begun, did upon the feventein Mais 1580, which
was 5 weeks after the slaughter, take from Laird Joby a new dif-
positione of the estate of Innes.
By what is said Innermarky may appeir to have been a man full
of unrighteoufnefs, craft and cruelty; yet some fay for alleviatione of
his fact, that he having his chieff’s favour hade got the first difpofi-
tion of his eftate failieing airs of himfelf, but that Cromy had taken
a posterior right and hade supplanted Innermarky, for qc he in re-

it is) is plaine past contradiQtione, from the above narraitted writ,

Laird of Innes, the fon of Alex’, came North with a commission a-
gainst them and all others concerned in the laughter of his father,
This Robert was a young man weil endued wt favour and under-

' standing, which had ingaged the Lord Treasurer fo far to wedd
his interest, that he first weded the young man to his daughter, and
then gott him all the affiftance requifit to poffefs him of his eftate,
q™ was no sooner done but he led waft the possessions of his ene-
mies ; burning and blood shed was a¢ted by both partys with ani-
moufly enough.

In the mean tyme Laird Jobz had run away to feek some lurking
Place in the South, q* he was discovered by the friends of the Lord
Elpbinftoune, and by them taken and sent North to the Laird Ro-
bert, who did not put him to death, but took him bound to various
forts of performances, as appears by the contract betwixt them in
Anno 1585: one gross was, yt he should deliver up the chartor
chist, and all the old evidents, q he and Innermarky had feafed,
and which I doubt if ever he faithfully did, els this relation hade
been with less pains and more fully inftructed.

As to Innermarky, he was forced for a while to take the hills,
and when he wearied of that, he hade a retreat of a difficult access
within the houss of Edinglafy, q* he fleeped in little enough fecu-

NUMBER


### 5. OF CATHNESS, STRATHNAVER, AND SUTHERLAND;

By the Rev. Mr. ALEXANDER Pope, Minister of Reay.
A’ the Pifs possessed the Northern parts of Scotland of old, as
. they did the most fertile parts of the South, and were expelled
in the year 839, we have very little of their history : what preserves
the remembrance of that people is only the round buildings wherein
they dwelt, of which there are numbers over all the North, parti-
cularly Sutherland, Cathness, and Orkney.

. It is observable in these buildings, that there is no mortar of any
kind, neither clay nor lime; nor had they any notion of casting an
arch. They consist of the best stones they could find, well laid and
joined the wall was sometimes 14 feet thick, and the great room,
which was quite round, 22 feet diameter; the perpendicular wall
32 feet high ; and the roof was carried on round about with long

stones

stones, till it ended in an opening at the top ; which served both for
light and a vent to carry off the smoke of their fire. Where the
stones were long and good, they had small rooms for sleeping in the
thickness of their wall. The door or entry was low, 3 feet for
ordinary, shut up by a large broad stone. There. is one of them
entire in the parish of Zotb, which the bishop of Offory visited and
examined. It is the only one that is so, as far as I could find, ex-
.cepting one at Suispil in the parish of Kildonnan. It is to be observed
that where the stones were not flat and well bedded, for fear the
outer wall should fail, they built great heaps of stones to support it,
fo that it looks outwardly like a heap without any design, which is .
the case at Loth beg in the parish of Lothis. At the desire of the
Bishop of Offry I measured several of them, and saw some quite
demolished. We found nothing in them but hand-mills, or what
the Highlanders call Querns, which were only 18 inches diameter,
and great heaps of deer bones and horns, as they lived much more
by hunting than any other means,

Figure 1. in table XLVI. represents the fection of an entire build-
ing. The thickness of the wall is about fourteen feet ; the diameter
of the area about twenty-two ; the height to the spring of the arch
twelve. ;

Figure 2. in the fame plate, is the ground-plot with a view of the
entrance; and of eight lodging-rooms of an oval form in the middle
of the wall.

Figure 1. in plate XLVII. shews a double house of the same kind
in the valley of Lotb.

retreats in the hunting countries, They confift of a gallery, with a
number of small rooms on the fides, each formed of three large
ftones, viz, one on each fide, and a third by way of covering. Thefe
are made with the vast flags this country is famous for. At theex-
tremity is a larger apartment of an oval figure, probably the quarters
of the chieftain. The passage or gallery is without a roof; a proof
that they were only temporary habitations. Their length is from
fifty to sixty feet. These buildings are only in places where the
great flags are plentiful. In Glen-Loch are three, and are called by
the country people Uags.

. I beg leave to. make a few more remarks on the round edifices,
They were large or fmall, according to the size or goodness of the
stones in their neighborhood. The stones that formed the roof were
placed thus : the largest lay lowest, the remainder grew successively
smaller and thinner to the top; so that there was no danger of its
falling in by too great a preffure. The builders took great pains to
bed their stones well ; and where two met, they were wont to band
them above by another, and to pin them tight to make them firm.
The doors were always on the East side, and only three feet wide at
the entrance, but grew higher within, and were closed with a great
flag. They. usually introduced water into these houses, where they
formed a well, and covered it with a flag stone, A deep ditch fur-
rounded the outfides of many of thefe buildings. The dead were
interred at some distance from the houses. The cemiteries were of
two kinds. In some places the deceased were placed within great
circles of stones of a hundred feet diameter, and the corpses covered
with gravel. In other places, they were interred in cairns of a sugar-
loaf form: sometimes bones have been found in them, sometimes

urns

APPEND I X 330
urns with ashes, a proof that burning and the common species of
interment was usual. Sometimes the remains of iron weapons have ;
been found, but fo corroded that their form could not be diftin-
guifhed. In one was found a brazen head of a fpear nine inches
long.
If these buildings were the work of the Piés, they originally ex-
tended over many parts of Scotland fouth of this country. The laft
have been fo long in a ftate of cultivation, that it is not furprifing
that we fee none of thefe houfes at prefent, the ftones having been
applied to various uses. Even in these remote parts, they are con-
tinually deftroyed as farming gains ground, they offer a ready quarry ;
to the hufbandman for making inclofures, or other purpofes of his
business. |
From the extirpation of the Pi#s to the year 1266, Scotland was
harraffed by invasions from the Norwegians and Dayes, particularly
the North part; for Harold the fair, King of Norway, seized Orkney
in the latter end of the gth century. From Norway {warms came to
Orkney, and the paffage being fo fhort, all the North of Scotland was
continually in arms. As nothing can be expected in that period but
fighting, bloodfhed and rapine, we cannot look for improve-
ments of any kind, and for that reafon it is needlefs to attempt any
particular history of it. It is true, Torfeus gives us some account
of that time, which is all that we have. _
As to the family of Sutherland, they have possessed that country
; fince the expulsion of the Pi#s, and have continued as Thanes and
Earls to this time. That they are originally of German extraction,
is evident from their arms, Doctor Abercrombie, in his History of
the Scots Heroes, mentions Donald Thane of Sutherland married to
Xx2 © A niece

4
340 APPEND I Xx
a niece of King Kenneth IT. May that good family continue and
prosper !
Lord Reay's family derive their original from Ireland, in the 12th
. century, when King William the Lion reigned. The occasion of their |
settling in the North is mentioned by Torfus, as captains of a num-
ber of warriors to drive the Norwegians out of Cathne/s.
The Sinclairs Earls of Cathness are only of a late date. The fa-
mily of Rosiin is their original in Scotland: but their coming into
England is as early as the year 1066 : for I find them mentioned
among the commanders in the army of Wiliam the Conqueror, in
the roll of Batte/ abbey. They were first Earls of Orkney, then Earls
of Cathness, and ftilt continue in the person of William Sinclair of
Ratter, who carried the peerage before. the British parliament this
present year 1772.
As for the history of these parts, I shall begin with. -
EDRACHILIS.
This parish, which belongs to the family of Reay, is all forest and ;
. - rocks, little arable, and scarcely any plain ground, excepting the
town of Scoury. The pasture is fine, and plenty of red deer, but the
country at some distance looks as if one hill was piled upon another.
The firth that runs far into the land abounds with good fish, and
herring in their season.
Torfeus mentions a. bloody battle fought in this firth, at a place
called Glen du, by. two pirates ; one of them he calls Odranus Gilkius, |
the other Suenus, wherein the latter was victorious. There is like- |
wise a tradition of some bloody engagements betwixt the Mackays and |
Macleads.. | | |

APPEND I x 341
Parish oF DIURNESS.

This parish was of old a grass room or shealing to the Bishop of
: Cathness, and was disposed of to the family of Sutherland by Bp. An-
drew Stuart, and the family of Sutherland gave it to Lord Reay's fa-
mily, Two pieces of antiquity are to be seen in this parish : ist.
Dornadilla's tower or hunting-houfe, which stands in Strathmore; a
very strange kind of building,. well worth the feeing.*. It is certain
that the finest pasture. is in the hills of Diurnefs, which rendered it
the best forest in Scotland of old. Our ancient Scots Kings hunted
there frequently, and it appears that this was a custom as far back
as the time of King Dornadilla. 2d. There is on the side of a hill
called Bui spinunn, a square piece of building, about 3 feet high and
12 square, well levelled, called Carn nri, or King’s carn, which pro-
bably was the place where his Majesty fat or ftood,.and saw the sport,
as he had from hence an extensive profpect. Torfeus mentions that .
one Suenus from Orkney waited on the King of Scotland as he was di-
verting himself in. the hunting season in the hills of Diurness. This
should be in the days of Malcolm I.

At Loch-eribol, on the North fide, there is a plain. rock which is.
still called Lech vuaies, where they fay that Hacon, King of Norway, -
flaughtered the cattle he took from. the natives in. his return to
Orkney, after the battle of Largis in the year 1263. Torfeeus gives a
journal of that expedition, and mentions King Hacon’s landing there.
But there is a tradition that a party of Norwegians, venturing too far

| ® A farther account of this tower will be given in the Tour and Voyage off

Ze -

WW into

342 APPENDIX
into that country, were cut to pieces ; and that the place is called
Strath urradale, from the name of the Norwegian commander: a
custom very common of old.

, The greatest curiosity in this parish is a cave called Smow. It is
a ftupendous arch or vault, and runs under ground fo far that the
extremity of it was never found. Donald Lord Reay, the firft of

. - that family, made an attempt, and we are told he proceeded very far,
meeting with lakes, and passing through them in a boat: bur, after
all, was obliged to fatisfy himfelf with feeing a part.

Here are several caves that run far under ground, but Smow is the
moft remarkable. I am told that of late they have difcovered in the .
manor or mains of Diurness, a hole of great depth : it was of old
covered with large stones, but these it seems have mouldered away.

So that it is the conjecture of many, that there are numbers of cavities
of great extent, under ground, in this parish,

This parish is all upon the lime stone, and abounds in marble;
the part called strictly Diurness, is a plain, the foil good, and the
grass incomparable, therefore capable of the highest improvement,
The lakes are stored with the finest fish, and full of marle. The hills
afford the best pasturage for sheep, and the seas are well stored with
fish, But the great disadvantage to this country is, that it is exposed

to the North-West storms, which drive the sand upon it, and have by
that means destroyed several good farms, and threaten more harm
daily.
; In this parish is a firth called Loch-Eribol ; Torfeus calls it Goas-
; ford, or the firth of Hoan, an island opposite to it. This is one of
the finest and safest raads for shipping in Eyrope ; the navy of
Great Britain can enter into it at low water, and find good anchoring.
| It

APPEND I x 343
It is a loss that this incomparable bay has not been surveyed, and |
the different anchoring places marked. It would be a mighty
bleffing to mariners, being fo near Cape Wrath, one of the most
stormy capes in the world. For it would be a safe retreat to vessels,
in time of storm, either sailing towards the cape, or to those that had
the misfortune to receive any damage off it. Cape Wrath is also in
the parish of Diurne/s.
Parish oF FONGU E,

Fhe antiquities of this parish are few. There is an old Danifb
building upon the fummit of a hill, called Cafel varrich, or Barr
castle : for the Danes or Norwegians possessed that country for some
time. Tongue is the feat of Lord Reay's family. This parish is
rather better for pafture than tillage, but what corn ground they
have is extremely good. Of old there was a fine foreft in it, and
there is still plenty of deer. The ancestors of Lord Reay’s family
drove the Danes from these parts, I

In this parish is a loch, called Loch-Hacon ; in it an island, called.
Hlan Lochan Hacon, in which there is the ruin of a stone building.
with an artificial walk in it, called Grianay, because dry and exposed
to the sun. From which it appears that Earl Hacon, who possessed
Orkney and Cathness, had a hunting house in this island, and lodged
there with his warriors, in the hunting season. The fea-coaft for the
greatest part is all rock, of a rough granite, or what we call whin.
Here is a promontory or cape, called Whiten bead, very stormy when
it is a hard gale.

There was formerly a chapel in an ifland near Skerray ; the com-

mon

344 APPEND I Xx.

‘mon people call it the Isle of Saints; it goes by the name of [and

comb. |
° Another island, called lan na nroan, all a high rock, but good
- land, and plenty of water and moss. It might be rendered impreg-
- nable. Both these islands are in the parish of Tongue. I have been
. in Nan comb. If the sand had not over-run a part, it would be a

- charming place.

A bloody battle was fought in this parish, of old, by one
of the ancestors of Lord Reay, against one Angus Murray, a
Sutberland man, wherein the Sutherland men were cut to pieces.
The field of battle is called Drim na coub. And in the fame
place there was a skirmish betwixt Lord Reay’s men, and a aum-

. .ber of Frenchmen that were on board the Hazard sloop of war,
in 1746: fome of the French were killed, and the reft taken
prisoners.

This parish is remarkable for an excellent ebb, where they have
the finest cockles, muscles, spout fish, .and flounders or floaks ;
which is a great blessing to the poor, and no small benefit to the rich.
And in the firth of Tongue there is a fine ifland, abounding with rab-
bets, called Rabbet Ile. It has many lochs, or fresh water lakes, full
of the fineft trout and falmon.

Parish or F AR.
The whole of these four parishes' was of old called Strathnaver,
from the river Navar, which was fo called, as some think, from the
name of one of King Kenneth the Second's warriors. It is a noble
body of water, well stored with salmon, having many fruitful and
beautiful
}

APPEND I x 345:

beautiful villages on the banks of it, and is fo inhabited for r8
miles,

At a place called Langdale there were noble remains of a Druidical
temple, being a circle of 100 feet diameter, and surrounded with a
trench, so that the earth formed a bank : in the midft of it a stone
was erected like a pillar, where the Druid stood and taught. The
country people have now trenched or delved that ground, and sown
it with corn. There was in that town a large round building, and a
Place where they buried of old.

This parish is of great extent, rather a country for pasture
than tillage. A great battle was fought of old at a place called
————, Harald or Harald's field or plain, betwixt Reginald King
of the Ifles, and Harald Earl of Orkney and Cathnefs. Harald
was well drubbed; and the field of battle is full of small cairns,
where the flain are buried, and some large stones erected like
pillars shew where persons of note were interred. Torfens tells
a long story about this affair; it seems that they had bloody
skirmishes at —, and near the manfe of Far, as appears
from the number of cairns in. both these places, There is a
most curious sepulchral monument in the churchyard of Far,
which may be of that date; it is of hard hill granite, well cut,
confidering the era of it. But what the meaning of the sculpture
is, we know not. Only we may guess, that the person for whofe
fake it was erected, was a Christian, because of the cross upon the
stone ; and that he was a warrior, because we see a shield or target
upon it, I have taken a draught of it.

In this parish, in old times, was a chapel at a town called Skaii,
upon the river Naver; another in the extremity thereof, at Moudale,

. Yy and

346 A PPEN DI Xx.
: and another at Strathie, the most beautiful and fertile part of the
_ parifh. .

. Betwixt Far and Kirtomy, in this parish, is a most fingular cu-
riolity, well worth the pains of a traveller to view, being the
remains of an old square building or tower, called Borve, ftand-
ing upon a small point joined to the continent by a narrow
neck of land not ten feet wide. This point or head is very
high, confifting of rock, and fome gravel on the top; on both
fides is very deep water, and a tolerable harbour for boats.
'Fhis tower seems to be. built by the Norwegians, and the tra-
= dition is, that one Therkel, or Torquil, a warrior mentioned by
Torfeus, was. the person that built it. They speak likewife of
a lady. that was concealed. there, she is said to be an Orkney
woman, and Torkel was an Orkney man. But. what is most cu-
rious, is, that through the rock upon which. the tower stands,
there is. a. passage below of 200 feet in length, like a grand arch
or vault, thraugh which they row a boat. The writer has been
one. of. a. campany that rowed through it. ‘Phe passage is fo
long, that when you enter at one end, you- fancy that there is no
possibility to get out at the other, ef vice verss. How this hard
rock was thus. bored or excavated, I cannot fay; but it is
, © one of the. most curious natural arches, perhaps, in the known

world. .
In this parifh there is also a promontory, called Sirathy bead;
Ptolemy. the Geographer calls it Vervadrum, as he calls. Cape
Wrath, Tarvedrum, and Dung sbey head, Berubinm. These three
promoatories. run in a line, from N. W. to North, and jut far
out. into the, sea, haying most rapid tides upon them. In Szrathy
. | bead

APPENDIX, ) 347
bead is a stately cave, called Uai wei, or cave where they find
driven wood or timber. The entrance into this cave is very
grand, the natural rock almost forming itself like the sway of
an arch : the writer hereof has admired the beauty of. it. This
promontory is the finest pasture for sheep and goats in the North of
Scotland.

To the North-East of Strathy there is a stone erected near the
highway, with a cross upon it, which shews its antiquity as a se-
pulchral monument. Erected stones were the distinguishing marks
of the graves of. persons of note in time of Paganism. And
after Christianity was planted in this kingdom, the diftinétion of

_ Pagan from Christian was, that a cross was cut upon the fepulchral
monuments of the latter, I have seen many with this diftinguifhing
badge.

No doubt there are mines in this country, if persons of skill '
examined our shores and rocks; as yet no pains have been
taken. I have been told that there is at Loch-Eribdl plenty of
iron ftone, and something like a tin mine. As I do not under-
ftand these things, I chuse to pass them over. As for sea-fish and
fhells, we have none extraordinary. It is true, in Cathness, John a
Groat's buckies are very curious and beautiful, of which we shall
take notice in the parish of Cannefoey.

Parish oF REAY.,

Some part of this parish lies in the shire of Sutherland, but
the greatest part in that of Catbness; that part in Sutberland is
called Strath-Halladale, from Halladba Eart of Orkney, a Norwe-

Yy2 . gian,

_ 348 A PEPN DI X.

: gian, slain in battle in- the beginning of the. 1oth century. The +
field of battle is full of small cairns, or heaps of stone. The
commander in chief, and prineipal. warriors slain in. that action,
are buried in a place apart from the field. of battle: I have
frequently seen the place. The tradition is, that Halladbha is
buried in a spot enclosed with a circular trench 1o or 12 feet
wide, and that. his fword lies by his. fide. There was a stone
erected in the middle of this circle, part of. which still remains,
Near the field of battle stands a little town, called Da! Halladba, or
Halladba’s field. A river runs through Stratb-Halladale, which is

- rather pasture ground on the sides, of it, for the eleven miles. it is
inhabited.

The boundary betwixt Sutherland and Catbne/s, to the: North, is

called Drim Halliftin. Cathness is a flat plain country, having few

i hills; the soil good,. and producing great. quantities of corn in
fruitful seasons ; it lies upon quarries of. a black slate: kind, and
perhaps no country on.earth excells it.for smooth thin flags or slates
of great dimensions. As thefe flags may be seen in. all parts of the
country, it is needless to.defcribe them. The. soil nat being deep,

and. the country flat, renders our highways very. deep in. winter,
and very. dry. in. summer. That part of the parish of Reay in the
shire of Cathness, is excellent corn ground through. the whole of it,
Tt appears that many battles have been fought in it in former times,
but we have no traditian concerning them.. In later times some
bloody skirmishes happened betwixt M * Kay of Strathnaver, and
Keith Earl. Mareschal; and also betwixt the Cathness and Stratb-
naver people.
The following chapels stood in this parish of old; St. Mary's at
Lybfter ,
. 
APPEND I x 349
'  Lybster;, St. Magnus's at Shebsber ; one at Shail, another at Baillie,
and a third in Shurerie ; besides the parish kirk dedicated to St.
Colman, at Reay. There is an old castle at Dunreay, and modern
houses both at Bighouse and Sandjide.
Lead mines are frequent in Cathness; but the country is fo flat,
that there is no working them for water, The most promising mine
is at Sand/ide, being in the face of a rock near the sea, It might
prove of value, ,if-proper pains were taken to work it. The high-
way runs near.it,
It feems that the Saxons, in the 5th century, plagued this coun- =
try.; and it-is probable that Thurso is so called from Horse the
Saxon. general, who landed in the river of Thurso, or Inver-Horfa,
the landing-place of Horfa. And when the Saxons plundered Cath-
ness, it seems they had a bloody conflict with the natives, In this
parish there is a place called Tout Horsa, or Horfa’s grave, where
they say that some great warrior. was slain and buried; in the place
is a great stone erected, Probably he. was. one of Hor/a’s captains,
This is the tradition.
Parish of THURS O-. .
Thursa, or Inver-Aorfe, fo called from the. Saxon general, is a: |
town of an old date; we find mention made of it as a populous
place.in the 11th century, .and from. it. the parish is denominated.
Formerly a strong castle stood in it, called Caftrum de -Thor/a ;
but no vestige of it is now: extant. The Earls of Cathness had
a. fine square at Thurso East now demolished. The Bishop of
Cathness had a strong castle at Scrabfer, near. Thurso, called the .
castle

$59 APPENDIX
castle of Berufide, built in the 13th century, by Gilbert Murray,
Bishop of Catbnefs: the ruins are still extant. Another castle
stood at Ormly, near Thurso; lately demolished. At Murkil, to
the East of Thurso, there were great buildings of old; it was a seat
of the late Earl of Cathnes5, and at Hamer he had a modern house,
* An old tower, still extant, stands at Brines, three miles West of
Thurso.
As for chapels and places of worship, one stood at Cross Kirk,
"one at Brines, another at Gwic, and a small chapel stood in the
parks of Thurso East, where Earl Harold the younger was buried.
The walls are fallen down; but Mr. Séaclair of Ulster, very
generously is determined to enclose that spot, because that young
nobleman is interred there. The church of Thurfo was the Bishop's
chapel; and when he refided in Cathness, he often preached there.
| I was told by the late Earl of Cathne/s, that there was a nun-
nery in ancient times near his feat at Muxrkil. The country
people call the place the Glefters ; but no vestige of the build-
ing is extant, excepting the remains of the garden wall, which
enclosed a rich spot of ground. Torfeus says that a Queen of
Norway lived sometime at Murkil, He relates that Harold the
| bloody, fon to Harold the fair, was banished for his cruelty,
with his Queen ; and that his brother Hacon succeeded to the
throne: but after Harold the bloody was slain in England, his
. Queen returned ta Orkney, and resided some time at Merkil in
Cathness.
The same author mentions great battles fought in this parish;
. - one in the 11th century, on the plains of Thurso Eaft, betwixt
Thorfnous Earl of Orkney, and one Karl or Charles; he calls him
- King

APPEND 1 x 35%
King of Scotland, or a General of the Scots army. Another bloody
battle at Claredon, near Thurso Eaft, betwixt the Earls Harold the
elder and younger. I have already told that Earl Harold the
, younger is buried near the field of battle, and a chapel ereéted over
his grave, which is now to be enclosed by Mr. Sinclair of Ulbfer, a
moft promifing youth.
The Bishop of Cathne/s, since the reformation, lived in a small
house at Scrabfter, which is {till extant, and. belongs to the crown,
He had a grass room in the Highlands, called Dorary, where stood
a chapel, called Gavin's Kirk, or Temple Gavin, the walls are till
standing. The river of Thur/o abounds with salmon, ten and eleven
lasts of fish have been caught.
Parish or OL RIG.
A fine corn country, two miles and a half in length, and a mile
broad, or thereabouts. Nothing memorable in it.
Parish oF DU NWNE T.
The Northerly winds have covered a great part of this parish with
fand; a large tract of ground is ruined and not likely to be reco-
vered. In this parish stands Dunnet bead, or what Ptolemy calls Be .
rubium, a large promontory, with a most terrible tide on the point:
of it. A hermit in ancient times lived upon it, the ruins of his
cell are extant. It is a fine fhcep pasture. The parish itself is an -

| Is a fine corn country, Here was the ancient residence of one of
the Governors of Cathness, under the Norwegian Lords that held
Orkney and Cathne/s. They dwelt at Dung/bey, and their office “
called the Prefefura de Dungalsbeis. Torfeus mentions bloody
battles fought betwixt the Scots and Norwegians, near Dungifby, in
sg : the roth century. And Ewin, King of Scotland, fought an army of |
= Orkney men, at Huna in this parish, and destroyed their King and |
his army. Here was, formerly, besides the parish church, a chape
at St. John's head, near Mey, and another at Freswick. >
At Mey there is a beautiful, strong castle, belonging to Sir Fobm
Sinclair. Here a kind of coal is found, like the Lanftaffen coal i |
Wales. At Frefwick stands a large modern haufe, the feat of Mr. |
- Fobn Sinclair. And there is a strong old castle, built on a high rock |
joined to the continent by a narrow neck of land to the South of |
Frefwick. Torfeus calls it Lambaburgum five caftrum agnorum. I

An island belongs to this parish, called Stroma, in which there is
a vault where they bury, built by one Kennedy of Carnmuch. The
coffins are laid on stools above ground. But the vault being on
the sea edge, and the rapid tides of the Pentland firth running by it,

into mummies; infomuch, that one Murdo Kennedy, fon of Caru-.

An excellent corn country, and a fruitful sea; 2000 barrels of
herrings were caught here in the year 1771. There was a chapel
near Castle Sinclair, called St. T, ay, another at Ulster, and a third
at 'Kihnister. The castle of Girnigo is the oldest building in this
parish. I cannot find out by whom it was erected. It is probable
* some strong building ftood here before the present ruinous house
was erected. It stands on a rock in the fea. Near it stood Castle
Sinclair, built by George Earl of Cathness; a grand house in those
days. Not far from it stood he castle of Akergil, built by Keith
Earl Mare/chal: but this place is now rendered a most beautiful
and convenient feat, by Sir William Dunbar of Hemprigs, the pro-
prietor. In the old tower is the largest vault in the North of Scot-
land, beautified with elegant lights and plaistering, by Sir Wilkam;
fo that it is now the grandeft room in all this part of the country. --
The town of Wick is a royal burgh, now rising since the herring
fishery has prospered. To the South of it stands an old tower,
called Lord Olfant's castle, A copper ore was discovered there,

and wrought for fome time, but I do not find they have proceeded
in it.

In this parish there is a haven for fishing boats, called Whakge,
which is a creek betwixt two high rocks. Though the height of
one of these rocks is surprizing, yet the country people have. made
steps by which they go up and down, carrying heavy burdens oa
their back; which a stranger, without seeing, would scarcely be-
lieve. This is a fine fishing coast.

There was a battle fought at Old Nameriuch, in 1680, betwixt
the Earl of Cathness, and Lord Glenurchy.

Eighteen miles long; partly pasture, partly corn ground. Itrhas
a chapel at Eafer Clyth, and another at the water of Danbtarh, be-

At the loch of Stemfer, in this parifh, stands a famous Druidicet
temple. 1 have viewed the place : the circle is large, above 100
feet diameter ; the stones are large and erect; and to fhew that the

' planetary system was observed by them, they are set up in this
manner, I: 2: 3: 4: 5: 6:7. Then the fame course begins again;

; temple there is a ruin, where the Arcb-Druid, it seems, resided.
I find no such large Druid - temples in the country ; as for small
ones, they are generally found in many places.
Upon a rock in the edge of the fea, in Zafer Chth, there is an
old building, called Cruner Gunn's castle. This gentleman of the .
name of Gunn, was Coronator or. Jufticiary of Cathness : he was
bafely

bafely murthered, with several gentlemen of the name, and of other
names, in the kirk of St. Teay, near Castle Sinclair, by Keith Earl
Marefcbal. The story is told at full length in the history of the
family of Sutherland. This happened in the 15th century. At
Mid Chth there was a large house, built by Sir George Sinclair of
Chth. At Nottingham there is an elegant new house, built by Capt.
Sutherland of Farfe: near this is the parish kirk. There is a strong
old castle at Dunbeath, and near Laxgwall is a strong old ruin,
faid to be Ronald Cheir's castle; he lived in the 14th century, and
was a great huntet of deer, as will be told when we come to speak
of the parish of Halkirk. He had a third part of Cathness in pro-
perty : his great estate was divided betwixt his two daughters; one
of which became a nun, the other married the ancestor of the
Lord Duffas. .
There is an old building at Lathrone, called Harold tower, said
to have been built by wicked Earl Harold, in the 12th century.
We read of bloody encounters in this parish, betwixt the Cathness
men, and Hugo Freskin Earl of Sutherland: and likewise many con-
fits betwixt the two countries in after-times. Torf.exs says that
King William the Lion marched into Cathness with a great army,
and encamped at Ox/dales, or Esfkenfdale. This expedition of his
Majesty's, was to drive out wicked Earl Harold the elder, who had
slain Harold the younger. The King seized Catbness as a conquest,
then Earl Harold submitted himself to him.

. land: and there was a square or court of building at Craiag, erected.
by Lady Fane Gordon; Countess of Sutherland, no vestige of it now:
extant.
There is-fine fishing in the rivers of Helmifdale and Loth. The
latter has a very high cataract, where the water pours from a high
- rock, and falls into a terrible gulph below. If this. could be re-
moved, this river would afford excellent salmon fishing. The hills.
in this parish were of old famous for hunting. At ——— there is
a hunting house, probably. built by the Ps, consisting of a great:
number of-small rooms, each composed of three large stones. These
"buildings prove that a tribe lived here in-the hunting season, Near
it stands a large P:#ifþ castle, called Carn Bran, It seems that thiss —
Rran, or Brian, was some great man in those days, and that all
these accommodations were. of his building, The quarry from
whence the stones. were carried to-build this castle, is still to be seen, .

the side of the hill.
I read of no battles in this parish : some bloody conflicts are told’
us, and these are to be seen in the histary of the. family of Sutherland.
Near the miln of Loth beg is the entire Pié?s house, which the Bishop,
of Offory entered, There is a fine cascade as you travel along the
shore under Loth beg, which makes a charming appearance when.
there is any fall of rain, or in time of a keen froft.

Partly corn ground, and partly fit for pasture. There was a :
chapel at Dol, called St. Mabon. No considerable buildings in
this parish, Sutherland of Clyne had a good house; and Nicolas '
Earl of Sutherland had a hunting feat in the Highlands, called
Castle Uain, but now demolished.
There is a tradition that a battle was fought at Kilalmkill, in this |
parish; wherein the country people routed the Danes; The com-
mon marks of a battle are visible there, viz. a number of small -
cairns. Another bloody battle was fought at Clyne Milton, betwixt:
the Sutherland and Cathness men; the slaughter was great, and the
cairns, still to be seen there, cover heaps of slain,
The river of Brora affords a fine salmon fishery : it falls into —_—
the fea at Brora. Within two large miles is the loch of that name,
which abounds with salmon. From the loch the river lies to the
West; and at a place called Achir-na-hyl, is a most- charming cas-
cade : here also they fish for pearls. On the top. of a small hill,
near the house of Ciyne, is a lime-stone quarry ; and in the heart of
the stone, all forts of fea shells known in these parts are found. _
They are frefh and entire, and the lime-ftone within the fhell re-
fembles the fish. The Bishop of Offory employed men to hew out
masses of the rock, which he broke, and carried away a large quan- . .
tity of shells. Near the bridge of Brora there is a fine large cave,
called Uai na Calman. The Bishop of Offory admired it, and said
there were such caves about Bethlebem in Palestine. The coal work -
and falt work are obvious here. But at Syratbleven, near the fea,
there -

358 APPEND I Xx.
there is a hermit's apartment, cut artificially in the natural rock,
well worth a visit from any cyrious traveller,
I need not mention the artificial island in the loch of Brora,
made by the old Thanes of Sutherland, as a place of refuge in
dangerous times, Near that loch stands a high hill or rock, called
Creig baw ir, on the summit of which there is great space. This
rock is fortified round; and as the neck that joins it to another
rock is small, it seems that when they were invaded by enemies,
they fled to this strong hold, and drove their cattle likewise into it
for safety. Others say it was a place for keeping of a watch.
Parish oF GOLSPIE. |
This is a fine corn country, The parish kirk was of old at
Culmalie, and at Gol/pie the family of Sutherland had a chapel of
ease, dedicated to St. Andrew the Apostle. In this parish stands
the seat of the Earls of Sutherland, at Dunrobin; but during the -
Danish wars, they lived at a greater distance from the fea. This
' parish affords no other great buildings; nor is there any tradition
concerning any battles fought in it: small skirmishes have happened
here; particularly in the year 1746, when the Earl of Cromarty
was taken prisoner. Most remarkable is the devastation done by
sand; large traéts of corn ground have been quite spoiled thereby,
and more mischief is threatened yearly.
Parish or DORNOCH.
| In this parish stands the cathedral church of Cathne/s. The
Norwegians

APPEND I Xx . 359

Norwegians having murthered Bishop John at Scrabfter, and Bishop
Adam at Halkirk, in the year 1222 ; Gilbert Murray, the succeeding
Bishop, built the cathedral at Dornoch, which was, when entire, a +
neat compact building. It was burnt in troublesome times, and
never fully repaired. The Bishop had a summer residence at
Skibo; but in winter he lived in his castle at Dornoch, the ruins of
which are to be seen. There was a stately fabrick of a church,
built in that town, in the 11th century, by St. Bar, Bishop of
Cathness ; but Bp. Murray thought it too small : it stood where the
council house now stands. We are told that the diocese of Cathness
was not divided into parishes till the days of Bp. Murray; and that
he translated the Psalms and Gospels into the Jif language, or Scots
Gakc. The dignified clergy had houses and glebes in Dornoch ;.
these made up his chapter when there was occasion to call one. Ir
is a loss that we have none of their records ; nor indeed is it a great
wonder, considering the daily invasions of the Danes, which ended-
not till 1266.

In Bp. Murray's time, there was a bloody battle fought at Hilton,.
near Embo; he and William Earl of Sutherland fought there against
the Danes, and cut them to pieces.. The Danyh General was killed,
and lies buried in. Hilton. There was a stone erected over his grave,
which the common people called Ree cross, or cross in Ri, or
King's cross, fancying that the King of Norway was there buried.
A brother of the Bishop was also killed in this battle; his body
hes in a stone coffin in the East isle of the cathedral, above ground, _
near the font. The hewn stotie erected to the Eaft of Dornech,.
is' a trophy of this victory. It has the Earl of Sutherland's arms
on the North fide, still very visible. and. the Bishop of Cathne/s’s

arms-

360 APPENDI X

arms on the South fide, but the heat of the fun has quite deftroyed

the fculpture.
The driving of sand is- very hurtful to this parish, and threatens
. still more harm, The only old buildings in it, excepting those al-
ready mentioned, is Skibo. Hugo Frefkin, Earl of Sutherland, gave
these lands to Bp. Gilbert Murray, then Archdeacon of Murray, in
1186. It paffed through feveral hands, till at laft ic came.to.Lord
Duffus's, and now it returns to the family of Sutherland. It was .a
; great pile of building, surrounded with a.rampart. The present
modern house is still habitable. The situation is most beautiful,
and a fine house there would have a noble effect. Cyder bell is only
a modern house. The plantations here, and at Skibo, are the most
- thriving in this parish. At the latter place a house was lately buile
in a very elegant taste. Embo is an old building, the seat of the
Knights of Embo. It is a pity that it has neither plantations nor

| policy about it.
Parish or CREICH

Has no great’ buildings in it. Pulcroffi is the best. The great
-cataract at Inversvin is a grand fight. Such a large body of water
_ pouring down from a high rock, cannot mifs affording entertain-
ment. The river of Shin abounds-with large salmon, and fturgeons
are often seen there. In the 11th or 12th century lived a great
man in this parish, called Paul Meutier. This warrior routed an
army of Danes near Creich. Tradition says that he gave his daugh-
ter in marriage to one Hulver, or Leander, a Dane, and with her,
the lands of Strabebee; and that from that marriage are descended

times Sateliites to the Earls of Sutherland. Their chieftain is lately
dead, and reprefented by two boys; it were to be wifhed that fome
generous perfon would take care of their education. The moft re-
markable piece of hiftory relating to this parith, is what Torfeus
mentions, viz, That Helga Countefs of Orkney, and her fifter
. Franbaurk, lived at Kinbrass, and supported a grand family there.
. . This lady had a daughter called Margeret, who was educated in.
these defarts, and there married Maddadius Earl of Athol, uncle's
| son to King David I. of Scotland. These buildings were burnt,
and reduced to heaps, fo that we cannot discern what their model
has been; at present, they are called Carn jonim And T arf aus.

fays that one Szexus burnt and demolished them.
What small skirmishes have happened in this parish, are not
worth mentioning, excepting what Torf.ew mentions relative to.
Kinbrafs, betwixt Suenus an Orkney. man, and Antver Rosta, captain:
of a guard, which an old wicked lady, called Fraubaurk, kept to.
defend her. This lady, we are told, had ordered a party to go
_ and murder Olafus, the father of Swenus, at Dung /bey; which party
Aulver commanded. They came to Dung /bey, and burnt that brave
man, and fix more with him, in his own house. "Luckily the Jady
of the house was absent, being invited to an entertainment in the
days of Chriftmas. Her son Gunnius, the ancestor of the Gunns,
was with her, and Suenus was also absent, After many years
Suenus comes with a party, attacks Aulver, and after a smart en-
gagement defeats him, fo that he fled, and as many as could made
, their

their escape with him. Swenus, after this, burns Fraubark, and all
her family, and made a heap of the buildings. And though the
ruins ate great, yet no man can tell of what kind they were; that
is, whether round like the Pi; houses, or not. This happened
in the 12th century.
Parisn of HALKIRK.
Partly corn land, partly pasture. Many places of worship have
been in this parish ; such as the parish kirk of Skinnan, the hospital
of St. Magnus at Spittal, the walls of the church belonging to it
being still extant. The chapel of Olgrim beg. The chapel of St.
_ Trostin, at. Westfield. The chapel of St. Queran, at Strathmore.
Another chapel at Dilred. And as the Bishop of Cathne/s lived of
old at Haskirk, his chapel was called St. Kathrin, of which there is
no vestige left but a heap of rubbish.
The Norwegian Lords that were superiors of Cathnefs, built the :
castle of Braal. Here lived Earl Fobn, who is faid to have caused
the burning of the Bishop of Catbness. This Bishop, whofe name
was Adam, lived near the place where the minister's house stands,
too near the bloody Earl. It is said he was severe in exacting tithes,
which made the country people complain : whereupon the. Earl
told them that they should take the Bishop and boil him, Accord-
ingly they went on furiously, and boiled the Bishop in his own house,
together with one Sersp a monk, his companion, in the year 1222.
King Alexander [1]. came in person to Cathness, and, it is said, exe-
cuted near 80 persons concerned in that murder. The Earl fled,
Aaa2 but

364 APPEND I X
but was afterwards pardoned by the King: However, some time aft
ter, he was killed in the town of Thurfo, by some persons whom he
designed to murder. At Braal there: was a fine garden, beside
which they. catch. the. first salmon from the month of November
. to the month of August. The situation is most beautiful, very
well adapted for the seat of a great man. The castle of Dilred was.
built by Sutherland of Dilred, descended from the family of Suther-- ©
land. It is a small building on the top of a rock. His fon, Alex--
ander Sutherland, forfeited his estate ; and these lands were given to
the ancestor of Lord Reay, but now belong to Mr. Sinclair of Ulb-
freer.
* Up the river stand3 an old ruin, called Lord Chein’s, or Ronald

great part of his time-in that exercise. The house stood at the outlet

a mile long, and” near that in breadth, and is the best fish pond in
Britain many lasts are caught every year on the shore of this loch, .
by the country people. Sixty nets are for ordinary shot on it in a

This was in the 12th century. Two battles were fought by the
Danes in tha dales of the parish of Halkirk. One at Toftin-gale, the
grave of the foreigners. A Scots nobleman, whom Torfeus calls .
- Comes Magbragdus, commanded on one fide; and a Norwegian, called
Liotus, on the other. Liotus was mortally wounded, and buried at
Sten-hou, near the kirk of Watten. The other battle was fought at
Halfary. The large ftones erected at Rangag' and thereabout, are
sepulchral monuments, where persons of note are buried. There .
was a battle fought in the 16th century, by the Gunns and others,.
at a place called Blarnandofs, near Harpi/dale, wherein the Gunns were
routed. The beautiful river of Thurso runs through this parish, and

_ upon a green spot of ground, which is said to be the fepulchral
monument of this Earl, The Monkish tradition is, that St. Magnus _.
converted a dragon into this stone. This 1s as true as what they
relate of his croffing the Peniland firth upon a stone, and that the

N. B. In the history of the family of Sutherland, mention is
made of one Sir Paul Menzies, Provost of Aberdeen, who discovered
a filver mine in Sutherland, and found it to be rich, but death pre-
vented his working it, It seems he covered the place where he
found it, and no perfon of skill has observed it since that time. It
is probable that.Creig nargod is the place where this mine may be,
and that this discovery was the cause of this appellation : for I can

### 6. THE LIFE OF SIR EWEN CAMERON, OF LOCHIEL.

THIS memoir, fo deferiptive of the: manners of the times, and the wild war
carried on. between the Hero of the piece, and Cresevel’s people, was commo-
nicated to me by a gentleman of Lochaber. It merits preservation not solely
on account of its curiosity ; but that it may prove an inftruétive lesson to the
present inhabitants of that extensive tract, by thewing the happiness they may
enjoy in the present calm, after the long florm of war and assaflination their
forefathers were cursed with.
__ Ewen Cameron was born in February, 1629. He lived with:
his fosterfather for the first seven years, according to an old:
custom in the Highlands, whereby the principal gentlemen of the
clan are entitled to the tuition and-fupport of their chief's children:
during the years of their pupillarity. The fofterfathers were alfo.
frequently at the charge of their education during that period; and.
when.

3&8 APPEND I Xx.
‘when the pupils returned home, these fathers gave them a portion
.equal to what they gave their own children as the portion consisted
in cattle, before ‘they came to age it increased to a considerable
.height. =_ , .

Before his years‘ of pupillarity expired, he was put under the
charge and management of the Marquils of Argyle, the fame who
was executed soon after the restoration, The Marquifs, intending
to bring him up in the principles.of the Covenanters, put him to
school at Tnverara, under the infpection of a Gentleman of his own
appointment. But young. Locbiel preferred the sport of the field
to the labours of the school. Argyle obferving this, brought him
-back to himfelf, and kept a watchful eye over him, carrying him °
along with him wherever he went.

Atter the defeat of the Royalists at Phikphaugh, in 1645, it hap-
pened that as the parliament fat at St. Ardrew's, on the trial of the

. prisoners of diftinétion there seized, Lochiel, who went there with
the Marquiss, found means to pay a vilit to Sir Robert Spot/woed,
one of the prisoners, a few days before his execution, Then - and
there it was he received the firit intelligence concerning the state
and principles of parties in Scotland. Sir Robert, happy to see his
young vifitant, the fon of his old acquaintance Fohn Cameron, took
the opportunity to relate in an eloquent manner, the causes of the
present rebellion, and its history trom its first breaking out, with a
view of the tempers and characters of the different factions that had
conspired against the Crown, He explained the nature of cur
constitution, insisted much on the integrity and benevolence of the
King, but inveighed bitterly against his Scotch enemies; and con-
cluded with expressing his astonishment how Lockiel's friends could
' put

APPEND I Xx: 369

put him under the charge of Argyle, and conjuring him to abandon
that part as soon as he could. This discourse had such an im-
preffion on the mind of Lochiel, that it continued all his life time.

Some time after, Argyle addressed his pupil in a different tone,
but had little influence over him: he never could be fatisfied why |
fo many brave fellows were executed, as he heard no confessions of
guilt, as thieves and robbers are wont to make; but dying with
the courage and resolution of Gentlemen. After this, Lochiel was
anxious to return to his country, inflamed with a desire of exerting
himself in the Royal cause, and of joining Montrose for that end.
Upon the application of his uncle Breadalbane, and the Camerons,
Argyle parted with his pupil; and he returned to Lochaber, to head
his clan in the 18th year of his age.
' An opportunity of acting the Chief soon occurred. Glengary
and Reppoch, Heads of two numerous tribes of the M*Donalds, re-
fused to pay Lochiel certain taxations for some lands they held of
him: Lochiel armed a body of the Camerons, with a view to compel
them ; Glengary and Reppoch, finding him thus bold and resolute,
thought proper to settle their affairs amicably, and gave him no
further trouble for the future. By such determined condu&, Loch- a
aber enjoyed a profound peace for some little time,’ while the whole
of Scotland besides was a scene of war and bloodshed. .

In 1651, Lochiel was honored with a letter from King Charles IT.
inviting him and his clan to use and put themselves in arms, for the

Royalifts had with Lilburne, Morgan, and others, Lochiel displayed

more conduct and vigor than could be expected from one fo young,

and as yet unexperienced in the art of war. He distinguished him-

self in a particular manner in a skirmish which happened between

, Glencairn and Col. Lilburne, at Brea-mar, where he was posted at a

pass, which he defended with great spirit, till Glencairn and his

army retreated to a place of security. Lilberne, in the mean time,

getting between Lochiel and the army, and finding it impossible to

draw out the General to an engagement, made a violent attack up-

on Lochiel : Lockiel, after making a bold resistance for some time,

at last retreated gradually up the hill, with his face to the enemy,

who durst not pursue him, on account of the ruggedness- of the

ground, and the snow that then covered it. Glencairw's army was at

this time full of factions and divisions ; occasioned by the number

of independent chiefs and gentlemen in his army, who would not

condescend to submit to one another, either in opinion or- action.

Lochiel was the only person of diftinétion that kept himself difen-

| gaged from these factions; for in order to avoid them, he always

chose the most distant parts, where his frequent successes had en-

deared him to the General, who recommended him in a strong

manner to the King, as appears by the following Letter his Majefty

fent him.

When General Middleton came from Holland, 1654, to take the
command of the King’s troops in Scotland, Lochiel joined him with a
full regiment of good men, while many of the other heads of clans
made their peace with General Monk, who had marched into the
Highlands at the head of a {mall army, giving another compo-
fed of horse and foot to General Morgan. Many trifling confliéts en-
sued between these two generals and the Highlanders ; but Lochiel
being of the party who had opposed Morgan, an aftive and brave
officer, run several hazards, and encountered many difficulties ; bur =_
his presence of mind and resolution never forsook him.

Monk left no method unattempted to bribe him into a submission.
These proposals were soengaging, that many of his friends importuned .
himtoacceptof them; but he despised them all, and would not fubmit.
Monk finding all his attempts ineffectual, refolved to plant a garrifon
at Inverlochy, where Fort William now stands, in order to keep the country
in awe, and their chief at home. Lochiel being informed of this design,
Bbb2 thought


372 APPEND I X
thought the most advisable plan would be to attack the enemy on
- their march from Iwverness, imagining they would come from that
place or that way ; but the sudden arrival of the English at fea dif
concerted all. his measures. They brought with them such plenty
of materials, and were in the neighhorhood of so much wood, that
in a day's time after their landing, Col. Bigan, their commander, and
the governor of the new fort to be erected, had secured his troops
from -all danger.

Locbiel saw all their motions from a neighboring eminence, and
seeing it impracticable to attack them with any probability of fuc-
cess, retired to a place three miles Westward, to a wood on the

North side of Lochiel, called Achdalew ; from this he could have a
full view of his enemy at Jnverlochy. All his men he dismissed to
remove their cattle farther from the enemy, and to furnish them-
selves with provisions: excepting about 38 persons whom he kept
as a guard. He also had spies in and. about the garrison, who in-
formed him of all their tranfactions,. Five days after their arrival at .
Inverlochy, the governor: dispatched 300 of his men on board of two
vessels which were to sail Westward a little, and to anchor on each side
of the shore near Acbdalew. Lochiel heard their design was to cut down
his trees and carry away his cattle, and was determined if poffible to
make them: pay well for every tree and every hide; favored by
the woods, he came pretty close to the shore, where he saw their mo-
tions so perfe&tly that he counted them as they came out of the ship,
and found the number of the armed exceed; 140, besides a number
of workmen with axes and other instruments.
Having fully satisfied himself, he returned to his friends, and asked
their opinion. The younger part of them were keen for attacking ;
but.

APPEND I xX. 373
but the older and the more experienced remonstrated against it, as a
most rash and hazardous enterprise. Lochiel then enquired of two
of the party who had served for some time under Montrose if ever
they saw him engage on fo difadvantageous terms; they declared
they never did. He, however, animated by the ardor of youth, or
prompted by emulation, (for Montrofe was always in his mouth) in-
fifted in a fhort but fpirited harangue, that if his people had any re-
gard for their King or their Chief, or any principle of honor, the
English should be attacked: © for,” says he, © if every man kills his
man, which I hope you will do, I will answer for the rest.” Upon this,
none of his party made further opposition, but begged that he and
his brother Allan should stand at a distance from the danger. Lochiel
could not hear with patience the proposal with regard to himself, |
but commanded that his brother Alan should be bound to a tree,
and that a little boy should be left to attend him ; but he soon flat-
tered or threatened the boy to disengage him, and ran to the conflict,
The Camerons being some more than thirty in number, armed
partly with musquets, and partly with bows, kept up their pieces .
and arrows till their very muzzles and points almost touched their -
' enemies” breasts, when the very first fire took_ down above 30,
They then laid on with their swords, and laid about with incredible
fury. The Engh/b defended- themselves with their musquets and
bayonets with great bravery, but to little purpose. The skirmish
continued long, and obstinate : at last the English gave way, and
retreated towards the ship, with their faces to the enemy, fighting -
with astonishing resolution, But Lochzel, to prevent their flight,
commanded two or three of his men to run before, and from behind
a.bush to make a. noise, as if there was another party of Highland-
ers

374 A PPEN DI Xx.

ers to intercept their retreat. This took fo effectually, that they
ftopped, and animated by rage, madnefs, and defpair, they renew-
ed the fkirmifh with greater fury than ever, and wanted nothing
but proper arms to make Lochiel repent of his stratagem. They

were at last, however, forced to give way, and betake themselves
to their heels ; the Camerons pursued them chin deep in the fea;
138 were counted dead of the English, and of the Camerons only five
were killed.

In this engagement Lochiel himself had feveral wonderful e
scapes. In the retreat of the Enghfh, one of the strongest and bravest
of the officers retired behind a bush, when he observed Lochiel pur-
suing, and seeing him unaccompanied with any, he leaped our,
and thought him his prey. They met one another with equal fury.
The combat was long, and doubtful. The Engl gentleman had
by far the advantage in ftrength and size; but Lechiel exceeding him
in nimbleness and agility, in the end tript the sword out of his hand:
upon which, his antagonist few upon him with amazing rapidity ,
they closed, and wrestled till both fell to the ground in each other's
arms. The Engh/b Officer got above Lochiel, and preffed him hard;

| but stretching forth his neck by attempting to disengage himself,
Lochiel, who by this time had his hands at liberty, with his left hand

seized him by the collar, and jumping at his extended throat, he

bit it with his teeth quite through, and kept such a hold of his grip,

that he brought away his mouthful; this, he said, was the /weeref

bite be ever had in his life time. Immediately afterwards, when con-
tinuing the pursuit after that encounter was over, he found his men

chin deep in the sea; he quickly followed them, and observing a

: fellow on deck aiming his piece at him, plunged into the fea, and

escaped,


APPEND I x 375
escaped, but fo narrewly that the hair on the back part of his head
was cut, and a little of the skin ruffled. In a little while a similar .
attempt was made to shoot him : his fosterbrother threw himself be-
fore him, and received the shot in his mouth and breast, preferring
his Chief's life to his own.
In a few days afterwards, resolving to return to Gen. Middleton, he :
ordered all his men to assemble and join him; but while he waited
for their -return, he cut off another party of the garrison soldiers,
who were marching into the country, at Azchentore, within half a
mile of the fort, killed a few, and took several prisoners. His
former engagements with the General obliged him art last to join,
which he did, with a great number of his clan; but was not long
with him when he had certain information, that the Governor of
Inverlochy availed himself of LochiePs absence, by making his troops
cut down the woods, and collect all the provisions in the country,
His return to Lochaber being neceffary, Middleton agreed to it, upon
condition he would leave the greateft part of his men behind him.
This he did, and fet out privately for his country with only 150
men. He soon found his information was too true: in order to
obtain redress, he posted his men, early in the morning of the day
after his arrival, in different parts of a wood called Stronnevi/s,
within a mile of the garrison, where the soldiers used to come out
every morning, to cut and bring in wood. Four or five hundred
came in the ordinary manner. Lochiel, observing them from a con-
venient part of the wood where he rested, gave the signal at a proper
time. His men soon made the attack, the enemy were soon
routed, and a great slaughter made; 100 fell upon the spot, and
the pursuit was carried on to the very walls of the garrison. It is
remarkable,

376 APPEND I x

remarkable, that not an officer escaped, they being the only a@ive
persons, that made resistance. Thus continued Lochiel for some
time a pest to the garrison, frequently cutting off small detachments,
partly by ftratagem, partly by force; but his name carried fo much
terror with it, that they gave him no opportunity for some time of

doing them much harm. |
Gen. Middleton being at this time extremely uMuccessful in some
of his adventures, particularly in an action some of his troops had
lately with Major Gen. Morgan, at Lochgarry, where they were to-
tally defeated, sent an express to Lochiel, supplicating his presence,
chat measures might be concerted how to conclude the war in an
honorable manner. Lochiel resolved to go at the head of 300 men,
and made the proper preparations for his journey with all imagin-
able secrecy ; yet the Governor gets notice of his intended expedi-
tion, and orders Morgan if possible to intercept him. Middleton
was at Brae-mar, in the head of Aberdeenshire, between which place
and Lochaber there is a continued range of hills for upwards of
100 miles. Over these did he travel, sleeping in fhellings, (huts
which the herds build for shelter when in the mountains) on beds
of hedder with their crops turned upwards, without any covering
but his plaid. In the course of this expedition, he was like to be
surprized by the activity of Morgan once and again; but getting up
to the tops of the mountains, he always escaped the enemy, but
frequently not to their profit, as his men often run down the hill,
and after discharging a few pieces or arrows among them, would as

easily ascend.
= Soon after his junction with Afiddcton, the war was given over,
. .and Middleton retired to France, having presented Lochiel with a
most
: "
APPENDS! X. $27
moft favorable declaration, signed at Dunvegay, in Sky, March 31. -
5665. But though the war was thus given over in general, and
many of the nobility and heads of clans had submitted to Moné,
upon getting their estates restored, Lochiel still stood out, not able
to bear the infolence of the troops quartered in a garrison so near
him. For the governor, encouraged by the departure of Middleton,
and taking the advantage of Lochiel’s absence in Sky, ufed to allow
his officers to go out frequently in hunting parties, well guarded
with a good number of armed men, destroying the game. Lochiel,
on his return, having learned this, soon put a stop to their infolence; _ _ .
for convening a party of the Camerons, he watched one day at a
convenient place, while he saw one of these hunting parties com-
ing towards the hill whereon he fat, and having divided his men,
; and given them proper inftructions, the attack was made with fuc-
cess : most of the party were slain, and the reft taken prisoners,
The lofs of so many officers afforded new matter of grief and asto- =
nifhment to the Governor, and prompted him to make some at-
tempts to obtain redrefs, but they were all in vain, He, however,
by this time became acquainted with the situation and manners of
the country, and procured a number of mercenary defperadoes
around him, who gave him exatt intelligence of whatever happened.
This obliged Lochiel to flit his quarters to a farther distance from
the fort, while he employed fuch of his clan as continued’ faithful,
as counter-spies near the garrison; and by their means, the resolu-
tions and plans of the Governor were not only made public, but
many of his spies were detected and apprehended, whom Loekiel
ordered to be hung up, without any ceremony or form of trial.

Soon after his encounter with the hunting party, an exprefs came

to him from the Laird of M*Naughtin, a true Royalist in Cowal, a

country opposite to Inverara, in Argylbire, acquainting: him, that

there were in that country three Engi/b, and one Scotch Colonel,

with other Officers, who were deputed by Gen. Monk to furvey the

| forts and forfeited places in that part of the Highlands; and that
it was possible to seize them with a few stout fellows. Lochiel, re-

joiced at this intelligence, picked out 100 choice Camerons, with
whom he marched for Cowal, still keeping the tops of the moun-

tains, lest his designs should be discovered and published, There

he met his friend M*Naughtin, who informed him that the Officers

lay at a certain inn, well guarded with armed soldiers. Upon

which, he gave the proper orders to his men, who executed them

with fo much expedition and {kill, that the officers, servants, and

foldiers were all apprehended, and carried, almoft without halting,

. to a place of security, before they well knew where they were.

, This place was a small island in Loch-Ortnick, a fresh. water lake

. 12 miles in length, about 10 miles North of Inverlochy.

The prisoners, though terrified at first, were soon undeceived.

The horrible executions which Lachiel’s men made in the several

. rencounters they were engaged in, made his enemies believe him to
be cruel and fanguinary in his disposition ; but the gentle treatment,

and the great civility the prifoners met with, soon convinced them

of the contrary : he omitted nothing that could contribute to their

happiness ; but particularly he proposed and exhibited several hunt-

ing matches, which gave them great fatisfaction. During their im-

prifonment, they took the liberty now and then to reprefent to
| Lochiel


APPEN DI Xx 379
Lochiel the expediency and the prudence of a treaty with the Gene-
ral. He at first rejected the motion, and fcorned the advice; but
being often repeated, he began to give way to their reafonings, but
{till aid, that no wife man should trust his safety in the hands of
their pretended Protector, whofe whole life was a continued scene
gf ambition, rebellion, hypocrisy, and cruelty ; and that though he
was able to do little for the fervice of the King or his country, yet
would he always preserve his conscience and honor unstained, till
perhaps a more favorable opportunity of restoring the King might
offer. These conferences being often renewed, brought Lochie! to
declare himself in a more favorable manner, For the truth is, that
he diffembled his sentiments at first, wanting nothing so much as an
honorable treaty; for his country was impoverished, and his people
almost ruined. He still, however, protested, that before he would
consent to disarm himself and his clan, abjure his King, and take .
oaths to the Usurper, he would live as an outlaw and fugitive,
without regard to consequences. To this it was answered, that if _
he only shewed an inclination to submit, no oath should be required,
and he should have his own terms.
In consequence of this affirmation, Lochiel, with the advice of his
friends, made out a draught of his conditions, which were transmit-
ted to Gen. Monk, by Col. Campdel, one of the prisoners, he having
given his word of honor he would soon return. Upon receipt of
this, the General made out a new fet of articles, of much the same
nature with the draught sent, which he returned to Lochiel, signify-
- ing to him, if he agreed thereto they would stand good, otherwise
not. After making some small alterations, Lochiel consented, and
the Marquiss of fr7gyle became his guarantee. This treaty was


burned in a houfe of Lochiel’s, which was consumed by accident.
However, the most material articles are preserved in Monk’s letters

to him, and are as follows. ;
© No oath was required of Lochiel to Cromwell, but his word of
* honor to live in peace. He and his clan were allowed to keep
© their arms as before the war broke out, they behaving peaceably
* Reparation was to be made to Lochiel for what wood the Governor
' © of Inverlechy cut on his grounds. A free and full indemnity was
* granted him for all riots, depredations, and crimes committed by
© him or his men preceding the present treaty. Reparation was to
© be made to the tenants for all the losses they sustained from the
© garrison soldiers. The tithes, cefs, and other public burdens:
© which had not been paid during the wars, were remitted, on con-
© dition they should be paid afterwards, with several others of the
© like nature.* All that was demanded by Monk of Lochiel, was,
[ that he and his clan should lay down their arms in name of King
CHaRLEs Ll. before the Governor of Jrverlechy, and take them up
again in name of the States, without mentioning the Protector ; that
he would afterwards keep the peace, pay publick burdens, and

= fupprefs tumults, thefts, and depredations.
* These articles being agreed to, and subscribed by Monk and
- Lochiel, the prisoners were discharged, but Lochiel begged they
would honor him with their presence at the ceremony of laying
dawn their arms, which they complied with. Having convened a
refpectable number of his clan, he ranged them into companies,
under the command of the Captains of their refpective tribes, and
put himself at their head. In this manner he marched to Inverlochy,
in the same order as if going to battle, pipes playing, and colors flying.

The Governor drew out the foldiers, and put them in order on a
plain near the fort; placing them in two lines opposite to the
Camerans. Lochiel and the Governor first saluted each other as
friends. The articles of the treaty were then read, and the cere- ,
mony of laying down and taking up the arms performed, Both
parties afterwards partook of a splendid entertainment, prepared by
the Governor for the occasion to the great fatisfaction of all present. ;
Thus did Locbiel, the only Chief in the Highlands that continued
to fupport the Royal caufe after it was agreed the war fhould be
given over, at last submit in an honorable way. Monk sent him a
letter of thanks for his chearful compliance, dated at Dalkeith, °
5 June 1655.

During the remaining part of Oliver's life, and the reigns of
King CrarLes II. and James H., Lackiel lived chiefly at home, in
a broken kind of wanquility, occasioned by the distractions of the
times, and the pretensions of neighboring Chicfs and Lairds to
parts of his estate : but he always shewed so much prudence and
courage on every emergeney, as gained him the friendship of the
great and the esteem of all. He was held in particular favor by the
two brothers CHarLes and James, and received from them many .
marks of their royal regard. It may not be unworthy the attention.
of the curious to narrate the following incident..

Lochiel and the Laird of M*Imtofe had a long dispute concerning
some lands in Lochaber, M- Intosþ claimed them in consequence of
a grant of them he had from the Lord of the Ifles, afterwards con-
‘firmed by K. David Bruce: Lochiel’s plea was perpetual poffeffion.
The contest was often renewed, both at the law courts and by arms.
Many terms of accommodation were propafed to the contending

; parties, .


382 APPENDIX

parties, but in vain. King Crarces II. himfelf would needs be
the mediator ; but nothing but superior force would prevail. In
1665, M'‘Intop, with his own clan and the M*Phersons, convened
an army of 1500 men, with which he sets out for Lochaber.

Lochiel, aided by the M*Grepors, raises 1200, goo of which were
armed with guns, broad swords and targets, and 300 with bows
and arrows. (It is remarked, this was the last considerable body of
bowmen that ever was seen in the Highlands.) Just as they were
in view of one another, and almost ready to fight, the Earl of
Breadalbane, who was Cousin German to both, arrived at the head of
300 men, and immediately sent for the two Chiefs. He declared
whoever should oppose the terms he was to offer, he fhauld join the +
contrary party with all his power, and be his foe while he lived.
Accordingly proposals of agreement were made, and submitted to
by both parties. Lochiel continued in possession of the lands ; for
which a sum of money was given to M*Intosh, to renounce all
claims for the future, The articles of agreement were signed 2oth
September 1665, about 360 years after the commencement of the
quarrel ; and next day the two Chiefs had a friendly meeting, and
exchanged swords, The leading Gentlemen of both clans performed
the same friendly ceremony,

It must appear strange, that now not a bow is to be seen in the
Highlands, nor any propenfity towards that kind of armour, One
might imagine, when the difarming act took place, bows and arrows

| would have been a good fubftitute for guns; and, if I recollect
right, there is no prohibition of bows in the act.

At the revolution, Sir Ewen, who was always prepoffeffed in
favor of the hereditary right, and particularly for James, whose

friendship

APPEND IX 383
friendship he had often experienced, and was resolved to support his
cause, as far as he could, at all hazards, In this resolution he was
confirmed by a letter he had from James, dated 29 March 1689,
then in Ireland, solliciting his aid, and that of his friends. Upon
receipt of this letter, he visited all the neighboring Chiefs, and |
wrote to those at a distance, communicating to them the King's
letter, and calling a general meeting to concert what measures
should be taken. They affembled on May 13th, near his house,
and mutually engaged-to one another to support his Majesty's. interest
against all invaders. When Viscount Dundee got a commission
from King James to command his troops in Scotland, Lochiel
joined him with his clan, notwithstanding that Gen. M*Kay made
him great offers, both in money and titles, to abandon James’s
interest,
He made a distinguished figure at the skirmish of Killikrankze,
under Lord Dundee, against Gen. M*Kay, though then above the
age of fixty-three. He was the most fanguine man in the council
for fighting ;. and in the battle, though placed in the centre opposite
to Gen. M*Kay's own. regiment, yet spoke he to his men one by one,
and. took their several engagements either to conquer or die. Just
as. they began the fight, he fell upon this stratagem to encaurage
. his men : He commanded such of the Camerons as were posted near
him to make a great shout, which: being seconded by those who
stood on the right and left, run quickly through the whole army,
and was returned by the enemy. But the noise of the mufquets and. .
cannon, with the echoing of the hills, made the Highlanders fancy . :
that their fhouts were much louder and brifker than that of the
enemy ; and Lockiel cried out,.** Gentlemen, Take courage, the day
l . l oe is-

384 APPEND I Xx

* is ours: I am the oldest Commander in the army, and have al-
<* ways observed something ominous and fatal in such a dull, hollow,
** and feeble noise as the enemy made in their shout, which prognof-
* ticates that they are all doomed to die by our hands this night;
« whereas ours was brisk, lively, and strong, and shews we have
< vigor and courage.” These words spreading quickly through
the army, animated the troops in a strange manner. The event
justified the prediction: the Highlanders obtained a complete
victory. The battle was fought, 1689. Lochiel continued for some
time with that army ; but being dissatisfied with the condu@ of Can-
non and some of the principal Officers, retired to Lochaber, leaving

. his son in his place during the reft of the campaign.

When terms of submission were offered by King WiLL1am to the
outstanding Chiefs, though many were glad to accept of them, yet
Lochiel and a few others were determined to stand out, untill they had
King James's permission, which was at laft obtained, and only a few
days before King Wi1LL1am's indemnity expired.

There is nothing else memorable, in the publick way, in the life
of Sir Ewen Cameron. He outlived himself, becoming a second
child, even rocked in a cradle; fo much were the faculties of his
mind, and the members of his body, impaired. Hedied A.D. 1918,

### 7. OF THE MASSACRE OF THE COLQUHOUNS.

Tt the Baronage of Scotland, by Sir Robert Duglas, it appears that

in the years 1594 and 1595, the clan of M*Gregors with some
of their lawless neighbors, came down upon the low country of
Dumbartonshire, and committed vast outrages and depredations,
especially upon the territories of the Colqubouns.

In 1602 Humphry Colquboun raised his vassals and followers to
oppose them, and was joined by many of the gentlemen in the
neighborhood. Both parties met in Glenfrone, where a bloody con- -
flict ensued. They fought with great obftinacy till night parted
them, and many brave men were killed on both sides, but the
Colqubouns appear to have been worsted. . The Laird of Colquboun
escaped, and retired to a strong castle ; but was closely pursued by
a party of the enemy ; they broke into the castle, and found him in
a vault, where they instantly put him to death with many circum-
stances of cruelty. In the month of February it was that this
Humpbry Colquboun was slain ; at which time the young noblemen
and gentlemen who were at school at Dumbarton came as {pectators

Ddd to

. 386 APPENDIX |
to see the battle of Glenfrone, but were not suffered to approach near
the danger, but were shut up in a barn by the Colqubouns for safety.
The M‘Gregors prevailing, are said afterwards to have barbarously
put them all to death. .

This is the account given by the hiftorian of the family of Luss,
but Mr. Buchanan * asserts that the Laird of Luss escaped from the
battle, and was afterwards killed in Benachra Caftle by the M‘Far-
lanes, thro’ influence of a certain nobleman whom Lu/s had dif.

obliged.

Let these facts stand as related by the partizans of each house,
but from the various acts of council, and the great severity of them,
and by the frequent confirmation of them by atts of parliament for
near sjxty years afterwards, under different princes and different
influences, the necessity of the suppression of this unhappy clan, for
the common good, is tully evinced,

The humanity of the. present legislature did the last year repeal
these sanguinary acts; alledging, shat the causes indufive of them

for suppressing the name of Grazcour or M‘Grecour, are now little
known and have long ceased.
